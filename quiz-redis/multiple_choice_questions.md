**Answer:** `smembers [set_key]` lists all members of the specified set.

---


# Question: When performing `sdiff technology front_end`, why is `node.js` not part of the result?

**Answer:** Because `node.js` is present in both sets, so it is excluded from the difference which shows only unique members to the first set.

---


# Question: What is the significance of order of keys in the `sdiff` command?

**Answer:** The order matters; the command returns members present in the first key but not in the subsequent keys.

---

**Answer:** It shows the members unique to "technology" set that are not in "front\_end": `java`, `aws`, and `redis`.

---


# Question: What happens if the sets passed to `sinter` have no common members?

**Answer:** The command returns an empty list.

---


# Question: Explain the sequence of commands to find and store the common members of three sets: `technology`, `front_end`, and `new_set`.

**Answer:** Use `sinterstore destination_set technology front_end new_set` to store the common members into `destination_set`. If no common members exist, the destination set will be empty.

---


# Question: What command would you use to clear all members from a set in Redis?

**Answer:** `del [set_key]` deletes the entire set, effectively clearing all members.

---

# Question: How do Redis set commands treat members that appear in multiple sets when using `sdiff`?
