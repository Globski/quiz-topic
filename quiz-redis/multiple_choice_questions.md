---

# Question: What does a FastAPI path operation typically return?

**Answer:** Any return value, commonly a Python dictionary, which FastAPI automatically converts to JSON.

---

# Question: What is JSON and why is it important in APIs?

**Answer:** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a universal data format used to send and receive data between APIs and clients.

---

# Question: What happens if the decorator is removed from a FastAPI route function?

**Answer:** The function no longer behaves as an API endpoint; it becomes a plain Python function.

---

# Question: What does the decorator do in a FastAPI route?

**Answer:** It registers the function as an API endpoint (a path operation) that can respond to HTTP requests.

---

# Question: What symbol is used in Python to define a decorator?

**Answer:** The `@` symbol.

---

# Question: In FastAPI, what does the decorator typically reference?

**Answer:** The FastAPI app instance followed by the HTTP method and route path (e.g., `@app.get("/")`).

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the HTTP method in a FastAPI decorator?

**Answer:** It specifies which type of HTTP request (e.g., GET, POST) the endpoint should handle.

---

# Question: What are the four main HTTP methods supported in FastAPI?

**Answer:** `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

---

# Question: Where can a user learn more about HTTP methods?

**Answer:** The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) HTTP methods documentation page.

---

# Question: In FastAPI, what is the path argument in a decorator?

**Answer:** It defines the URL path after the domain name that maps to the route (e.g., `"/"` for the root path).

---

# Question: What does the root path (`"/"`) represent in a FastAPI route?

**Answer:** It corresponds to the base URL of the API, meaning no additional path after the domain is required.

---

# Question: Does adding or omitting a trailing slash in the root path change the behavior?

**Answer:** No, using or omitting the trailing slash (`/`) in the root path does not affect the behavior.

---

# Question: What happens when a `WATCH` is set on a key and a transaction is created in Redis?

**Answer:** If the watched key remains unchanged by other clients, the transaction executes successfully; if the key is changed by another client before the transaction executes, the transaction is aborted.

---

# Question: Will a transaction be aborted if the watched key is modified by the same client that initiated the transaction?

**Answer:** No, the transaction is only aborted if the watched key is changed by a **different client**.

---

# Question: In Redis, what does the `MULTI` command do?

**Answer:** It marks the start of a transaction block.

---

# Question: What is the role of the `EXEC` command in Redis transactions?

**Answer:** Yes, a client can subscribe to multiple channels simultaneously.

---

# Question: What command is used in Redis for subscribing to multiple channels with pattern matching?

**Answer:** `PSUBSCRIBE <pattern>`

---

# Question: In pattern-based subscriptions, what does the `*` wildcard character do?

**Answer:** It matches zero or more characters, allowing subscription to multiple channels with similar names (e.g., `news*` matches `news1`, `news2`, etc.).

---

# Question: What does the `?` wildcard character do in `PSUBSCRIBE`?

**Answer:** It matches exactly one character at that position in the channel name (e.g., `h?llo` matches `hello`, `hxllo`).

---

# Question: How can you subscribe to specific named channels like `ball` and `bill` using pattern matching?

**Answer:** Use a pattern like `b[ai]ll` which matches both `ball` and `bill`.

---
