# Question: What property must be set on a container to start using Flexbox?

**Answer:** The container must have `display: flex` set in the CSS.

---

# Question: What does setting `display: flex` do to a container's layout?

**Answer:** It creates two invisible axes: a main axis and a cross axis, and aligns child items along the main axis by default.

---

# Question: What is the default direction of the main axis in Flexbox?

**Answer:** Horizontal (left to right).

---

# Question: How do you change the main axis direction in Flexbox to vertical?

**Answer:** `row`, which is also the default value.

---

# Question: What property is used to align items along the main axis?

**Answer:** `justify-content`.

---

# Question: What does `justify-content: flex-start` do?

**Answer:** Aligns items to the start of the main axis. This is the default.

---

# Question: What does `justify-content: flex-end` do?

**Answer:** Pushes items to the end of the main axis.

---

# Question: What does `justify-content: center` do?

**Answer:** Centers items along the main axis.

---

# Question: What does `justify-content: space-between` do?

**Answer:** Distributes items evenly along the main axis, placing the first and last items at the ends with space in between.

---

# Question: What does `justify-content: space-around` do?

**Answer:** Distributes items with equal space around them, including space on the outer edges.

---

# Question: What does `justify-content: space-evenly` do?

**Answer:** Evenly distributes items so that the spacing between any two items (and the container edges) is equal.

**Answer:** Aligns the baseline of text across items, so their text baselines line up.

---

# Question: How can you see the effect of `align-items: baseline` clearly?

**Answer:** By increasing the font size of some items, you can see that the text baselines still align.

---

# Question: If `flex-direction` is not defined, what is the default value?

**Answer:** `row`.

---

# Question: What is the default direction of the cross axis?

**Answer:** Vertical (top to bottom), when `flex-direction` is `row`.

---

# Question: What happens to the main and cross axes when `flex-direction: column` is set?

**Answer:** The main axis becomes vertical, and the cross axis becomes horizontal.

---

# Question: In Flexbox, which property determines how items behave when they exceed the container width?

**Answer:** `flex-wrap`.

---

# Question: What is the default value of the `flex-wrap` property?

**Answer:** `nowrap`.

---

# Question: What does setting `flex-wrap: wrap` do?

**Answer:** Allows Flex items to wrap onto multiple lines instead of trying to fit into one.

---

# Question: What property enables wrapping behavior in a Flexbox container?

**Answer:** `flex-wrap`.

---

# Question: What must be true for the `align-content` property to have any effect?

**Answer:** The container must have `flex-wrap` set to `wrap`, and items must actually wrap to multiple lines.

---

# Question: What does the `align-content` property do in Flexbox?

**Answer:** It aligns multiple lines of Flex items along the cross axis.

---

# Question: What values can `align-content` take?

**Answer:** `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`.

---

**Answer:** On the Flex container.

---

# Question: Which Flexbox properties are applied to the **children** (Flex items) instead of the container?

**Answer:** `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`, `flex`, and `align-self`.

---

# Question: What does the `flex-grow` property do?

**Answer:** It allows a Flex item to grow and take up remaining space in the container based on a proportional value.

---

# Question: What type of value does `flex-grow` accept?

**Answer:** A unitless number representing proportion.

---

# Question: What happens if three Flex items all have `flex-grow: 1`?

**Answer:** They will each grow equally and share the remaining space evenly.

---

**Answer:** It defines how quickly an item shrinks relative to other items when space is limited.

---

# Question: What value should `flex-shrink` be set to in order to prevent shrinking?

**Answer:** `0`.

---

# Question: If `flex-shrink: 5` is applied to an item, what will happen?

**Answer:** That item will shrink five times faster than items with `flex-shrink: 1`.

---

# Question: What does the `flex-basis` property define?

**Answer:** The initial size of a Flex item before remaining space is distributed.

---

# Question: What happens if an item has both a `width` and a `flex-basis` value?

**Answer:** The `flex-basis` value will override the `width`.

---

# Question: What happens if `flex-basis` is set to `0`?

**Answer:** The item will shrink as much as possible before growing or distributing space.

---

# Question: What is the shorthand property for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`?

---

# Question: What is the default value of the `order` property in Flexbox?

**Answer:** `0`.

---

# Question: How can you make the last item appear first using the `order` property?

**Answer:** Set its `order` value to `-1`.

---

# Question: What happens if an item is given an `order` value of `1` while all other items remain at the default?

**Answer:** That item will appear after the others in the layout.

---

# Question: Why should the `order` property be used cautiously?

**Answer:** Because it can break the semantic structure and accessibility of the HTML document.

---

# Question: What is the first step when using Flexbox to create a layout in HTML?

**Answer:** Define a reference point in HTML, such as the `<body>` or a specific container element.

---

# Question: What happens to elements when `display: flex` is applied to their parent container?

**Answer:** The child elements are aligned side by side (horizontally), rather than stacked vertically.

---

# Question: What are the default display values for most HTML elements?

**Answer:** `block` or `inline`.

---

# Question: What behavior do block-level elements have by default?

```

---

# Question: Why does a Flexbox layout remain centered even when resizing the layout?

**Answer:** Because Flexbox is inherently flexible and adapts to the size changes of the container.

---

# Question: What are the three advanced values for `justify-content` and `align-items`?

**Answer:** `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`.

---

# Question: What does the `space-between` value do?

**Answer:** Distributes items evenly from left to right with the first and last items touching the edges of the container.

---

# Question: What is the behavior of `space-around` in Flexbox?

**Answer:** Gives equal space on both sides of each element, but results in doubled spacing between adjacent elements compared to the edges.

---

# Question: What issue can arise when using `space-around` in Flexbox?

**Answer:** The spacing between elements is twice as large as the space between the elements and the container's edges.

---

# Question: What is the advantage of using `space-evenly` in Flexbox?

**Answer:** It distributes equal space between all items and between the items and container edges, resulting in perfectly balanced spacing.

---

# Question: Do `justify-content` and `align-items` automatically adjust to container size changes?

**Answer:** Yes, all values adjust dynamically with container resizing.

---

# Question: Can the same values used in `justify-content` also be used in `align-items`?

**Answer:** Yes, but they may not be meaningful if there is only one row of content.

---

# Question: What Flexbox property controls the direction of the main axis?

**Answer:** `flex-direction`.

---

# Question: What is the default value of `flex-direction`?

**Answer:** `row`.

---

# Question: What does `flex-direction: row` do?

**Answer:** Sets the main axis to run from left to right.

---

# Question: What effect does `flex-direction: row-reverse` have?

**Answer:** Reverses the main axis to run from right to left, with items ordered accordingly.

---

# Question: What effect does `flex-direction: row-reverse` have on `justify-content` values?

**Answer:** It reverses the main axis direction, so `flex-start` aligns items to the right and `flex-end` to the left.

---

# Question: What does `flex-direction: column` do?

**Answer:** It changes the main axis to run from top to bottom, stacking elements vertically.

---

# Question: When using `flex-direction: column`, which property centers elements **horizontally**?

**Answer:** `align-items: center`.

---

# Question: Why is it important to remember the `flex-direction` of your layout?

**Answer:** Because it changes the orientation of the main and cross axes, which directly affects how alignment properties like `justify-content` and `align-items` behave.

---

# Question: What is the default value of `flex-direction` in Flexbox?

**Answer:** `row`.

---

# Question: What Flexbox configuration would you use to align all elements vertically while centering them horizontally?

**Answer:**

```css

flex-direction: column;
align-items: center;
```

---

# Question: What does the `gap` property do in a Flexbox layout?

**Answer:** It creates consistent spacing between items without needing to use margins.

---

# Question: Why is the `gap` property preferred over using margins in Flexbox?

**Answer:** Because it simplifies spacing between items and avoids issues like collapsing margins or asymmetric gaps.

---

# Question: What does the `flex-wrap` property control?

**Answer:** It determines whether Flexbox items stay in one line or wrap onto multiple lines when there isn't enough space.

---

# Question: What are the two main values of the `flex-wrap` property?

**Answer:** `wrap` and `nowrap`.

---

# Question: What happens when you use `flex-wrap: wrap`?

**Answer:** Items will wrap onto new lines when there isn't enough space in one line, creating a responsive layout.

---

# Question: What happens when you use `flex-wrap: nowrap`?

**Answer:** Items stay on a single line and shrink to fit the container, even if they overflow.

---

# Question: What Flexbox configuration can create a responsive layout that centers content and wraps items as needed?

**Answer:**

```css
display: flex;
flex-wrap: wrap;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

---

# Question: Why might there be a large gap between wrapped lines when using `flex-wrap`?

**Answer:** Because each wrapped line becomes its own flex container with its own main and cross axes, and spacing is controlled per line.

---

# Question: How does the number of items affect layout behavior when using `flex-wrap`?

**Answer:** More items can lead to multiple line breaks, with each line having its own main and cross axes, which impacts alignment.

---

# Question: How does `align-items` behave when multiple flex lines are present due to `flex-wrap`?

**Answer:** It controls the alignment of items within **each individual line**, not across all lines.

**Answer:** Aligns items at the end of each cross axis for each individual flex line.

---

# Question: What does `align-items: center` do in a multi-line Flexbox layout?

**Answer:** Aligns items to the center of each cross axis for each individual flex line.

---

# Question: What does the `align-content` property control in Flexbox?

**Answer:** It controls the alignment of **all lines together** in a multi-line flex container along the cross axis.

---

# Question: What is the default value of the `align-content` property?

**Answer:** `space-around`.

---

# Question: How does `align-items` differ from `align-content`?

**Answer:** `align-items` aligns **individual items** within each line on the cross axis, while `align-content` aligns **all lines as a group** on the cross axis.

---

# Question: What three Flexbox properties must be centered to achieve a perfectly centered layout that adapts to wrapping?

**Answer:**

```css
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
align-content: center;
```

---

# Question: How can you apply different vertical and horizontal gaps between Flexbox items?

**Answer:** Use `row-gap` for vertical spacing and `column-gap` for horizontal spacing.

---

# Question: What does `row-gap: 20px; column-gap: 10px;` do in a Flexbox layout?

**Answer:** It sets a 20px gap between rows and a 10px gap between columns.

---

# Question: Why is `gap` usually preferred over `row-gap` and `column-gap` in Flexbox layouts?

**Answer:** Because most layouts only need uniform spacing, making the single `gap` property simpler and more efficient to use.

---

# Question: Why are `row-gap` and `column-gap` more relevant to Grid layouts than Flexbox?

**Answer:** Because Grid layouts typically involve both row and column structures, making separate control of horizontal and vertical gaps more useful.

---

# Question: Can Flexbox be used on any HTML element or only on the `<body>`?

**Answer:** It can be used on **any HTML element**, not just the `<body>`.

---

# Question: How can you center the numbers **inside each box** using Flexbox?

**Answer:**

```css
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
```

---

# Question: When centering content **inside flex items**, where should the Flexbox properties be applied?

**Answer:** On the **individual item containers** (e.g., the box selectors), not the outer parent container.

---

# Question: What is the first step to create a layout where boxes resize responsively without wrapping?

**Answer:** Set `display: flex` on the container and **do not use** `flex-wrap`.

---

# Question: What Flexbox property enables boxes to shrink when the viewport gets too small?

**Answer:** `flex-shrink`.

---

# Question: On which elements is the `flex-shrink` property applied?

**Answer:** On the **flex items**, not the container.

---

# Question: What are the only two properties required on the container for a basic responsive resizing layout?

**Answer:**

```css
display: flex;
gap: 10px;
```
---

# Question: What does the `flex-shrink` property do?

**Answer:** It allows flex items to **shrink** when the container becomes too small to fit all items.

---

# Question: What is the default value of `flex-shrink`?

**Answer:** `1` — this means all flex items shrink by default if necessary.

---

# Question: What happens when you set `flex-shrink: 0` on a flex item?

**Answer:** The item will **not shrink**, even if there's not enough space, which may cause it to overflow.

---

# Question: When should you disable `flex-shrink` on a flex item?

**Answer:** When you don’t want the item to distort — for example, an image or icon.

---

# Question: What is the primary difference between `flex-shrink` and `flex-grow`?

**Answer:**

* `flex-shrink` controls **how much an item can shrink** if needed.
* `flex-grow` controls **how much an item can grow** to fill extra space.

---

# Question: What is the default value of `flex-grow`?

**Answer:** `0`, meaning items do **not grow** unless explicitly allowed.

---

# Question: What happens if you set `flex-grow: 1` on all flex items?

**Answer:** All items will **share the available space equally**, growing to fill the parent container.

---

# Question: What happens if one flex item has `flex-grow: 5` and others have `flex-grow: 1`?

**Answer:** The item with `flex-grow: 5` will grow **five times faster** than the others, taking up more space proportionally.

---

# Question: Do `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` work as simple on/off switches?

**Answer:** No, they act as **multipliers** and determine the proportion of growing or shrinking **relative to other items**.

---

# Question: How can you prevent only the **first box** from shrinking in a layout?

**Answer:** Assign `flex-shrink: 0` to the first box and leave the others at `flex-shrink: 1`.

---

# Question: How do you make a text element grow while its sibling elements (like buttons) stay the same size?

**Answer:** Apply `flex-grow: 1` to the text element and `flex-grow: 0` to the others.

---

# Question: In the context of responsive design, why is `flex-grow` useful?

**Answer:** It helps **dynamically allocate available space** to specific items, allowing layouts to **adapt smoothly to different screen sizes**.

---

# Question: Does setting `flex-grow: 5` guarantee that the item will be five times bigger?

**Answer:** No, it means the item will grow **five times faster than other items**, not necessarily be five times the size.

**Answer:** When **extra space becomes available**, the item with the higher `flex-grow` value takes a larger portion relative to others.

---

# Question: If a flex item has `flex-shrink: 5`, what does it mean?

**Answer:** It will shrink **five times faster** than items with `flex-shrink: 1` when space is limited.

---

# Question: Why would you use `min-width` and `max-width` with Flexbox?

**Answer:** To **limit how much an item can grow or shrink**, ensuring it doesn’t become too large or too small when resizing.

---

# Question: What happens if a flex item grows beyond its `max-width`?

**Answer:** It **stops growing** once it reaches the `max-width` and will not get larger.

---

# Question: What happens if a flex item shrinks below its `min-width`?

**Answer:** It will **overflow** the container instead of shrinking further.

---

# Question: How can you prevent shrinking but still allow items to wrap when the screen gets too small?

---

# Question: Which CSS property lets you align a **single flex item** differently along the **cross axis**?

**Answer:** `align-self`

---

# Question: How is `align-self` different from `align-items`?

**Answer:**

* `align-items` applies to **all flex items**,
* `align-self` overrides that setting **for individual items**.

---

# Question: Can you use `justify-self` to align a single flex item along the **main axis**?

**Answer:** No, `justify-self` **does not work in Flexbox** — it's a property used in **CSS Grid**.

---

# Question: If you want to position only the **first flex item** at the bottom while others stay at the top, which property do you use?

**Answer:** `align-self: flex-end` on the first item (with `align-items: flex-start` on the container).

---

# Question: How can you isolate alignment of individual flex items?

**Answer:** By applying the `align-self` property on the **specific item** you want to align differently.

---

# Question: Why is `justify-self` not available in Flexbox?

**Answer:** Because Flexbox is designed to **distribute space across the main axis** using group-based properties like `justify-content`, and individual item justification is handled differently — such as with **margins**.

---

# Question: What is the "old school" CSS technique to push all other elements to the right in a navigation bar?

**Answer:** Use `margin-right: auto` on the leftmost element (e.g., company logo) to push all other elements to the right.

---

# Question: In a navigation bar, how does `margin-right: auto` help with layout?

**Answer:** It forces the element with the margin to stay on the left while pushing the subsequent elements to the right.

---

# Question: What are the main axes used in CSS Flexbox for layout alignment?

**Answer:** The **main axis** and the **cross axis**.

---

# Question: Which Flexbox properties align elements along the main and cross axes?

**Answer:** `justify-content` aligns along the main axis, and `align-items` aligns along the cross axis.

---

# Question: How can you wrap elements to the next line using Flexbox?

**Answer:** Use `display: grid; place-content: center;`.

---

# Question: How many lines of CSS are typically required to center a div using Flexbox vs. Grid?

**Answer:** Flexbox requires **3 lines**; Grid requires **2 lines**.

---

# Question: What is the key difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid in terms of layout dimensions?

**Answer:** CSS Grid is two-dimensional, allowing positioning both horizontally and vertically at the same time.

---

# Question: What do the numbers on a CSS Grid represent?

**Answer:** They represent **grid lines** — row lines and column lines used for positioning elements.

---

# Question: What are the three key components of a CSS Grid layout?

**Answer:** **Cells**, **grid lines** (row and column lines), and **tracks** (rows and columns).

---

# Question: How do you begin creating a grid layout in HTML?

**Answer:** By creating a container `<div>` with a class (e.g., `container`) and child `<div>`s with item classes (e.g., `item`, `item-1`, `item-2`, etc.).

---

# Question: What CSS property turns a container into a grid?

**Answer:** `display: grid`

---

# Question: Why does setting `display: grid` not visually change anything by itself?

**Answer:** Because no **rows** or **columns** have been defined yet.

---

# Question: How do you define rows and columns in a grid?

**Answer:** Using the `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` properties.

---

# Question: How do `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` work?

**Answer:** Each value defines one **track** (row or column); multiple values create multiple tracks.

---

# Question: What happens if you define `grid-template-columns: 100px 100px`?

**Answer:** It creates two columns, each 100 pixels wide.

---

# Question: How do you create a grid with 6 rows and 6 columns of equal size?

**Answer:** Set both `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns` to six `100px` values.

---

**Answer:** Use `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`, `grid-column-start`, and `grid-column-end`.

---

# Question: How would you place an item starting on row line 1 and column line 1, ending at row line 3 and column line 5?

**Answer:**

```css
grid-row-start: 1;  
grid-row-end: 3;  
grid-column-start: 1;  
grid-column-end: 5;
```

---

# Question: What happens to other items when you explicitly position one item in the grid?

**Answer:** The unpositioned items are pushed out of the way automatically.

---

# Question: What is the shorthand for defining grid row and column start/end positions?

**Answer:** Use the `grid-row` and `grid-column` shorthand properties.

---

# Question: What syntax is used with `grid-row` and `grid-column` shorthands?

**Answer:** Two values separated by a slash: the **starting line** and the **ending line** (e.g., `grid-row: 1 / 3;`).

---

# Question: How do you use `grid-row` and `grid-column` to make an item span two rows and two columns?

**Answer:**

```css
grid-row: 1 / 3;  
grid-column: 5 / 7;
```

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the `span` keyword in grid positioning?

**Answer:** It allows an item to span a specific number of tracks from its current position without specifying start/end lines.

---

# Question: How would you use `span` to make an item span two columns?

**Answer:** `grid-column: span 2;`

---

# Question: What is a downside of using the `span` keyword?

**Answer:** You can't **explicitly define start and end positions**, so items may shift if nearby items change.

---

# Question: What can happen if you use `span` and a nearby item's size increases?

**Answer:** The item using `span` can be pushed away from its intended position.

---

# Question: When is it okay to use the `span` keyword in CSS Grid?

**Answer:** When you don’t need to anchor the item to a specific position.

---

# Question: What is the fastest way to position an item using four grid line values?

**Answer:** Use the `grid-area` property.

---

# Question: What are the four values required for the `grid-area` shorthand?

**Answer:** `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end`, in that order.

---

# Question: What is the syntax to make a grid item start at row 3, end at row -1, and span columns from 1 to -1?

**Answer:** Use `grid-area: 3 / 1 / -1 / -1;` which sets start-row, start-column, end-row, and end-column respectively.

---

# Question: What do negative numbers like `-1` represent in CSS Grid positioning?

**Answer:** Negative numbers count from the end of the grid, so `-1` refers to the last line of the grid in either rows or columns.

---

# Question: How many CSS properties does the `grid-area` shorthand replace?

**Answer:** It replaces six properties: `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, `grid-column-end`, and optionally positioning-related values.

---

# Question: How was layering done before CSS Grid, and what were its limitations?

**Answer:** It required `position: absolute` and manually adjusting `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`, making it difficult to maintain and position elements precisely.

---

# Question: How does CSS Grid simplify layering of items?

**Answer:** By allowing items to occupy the same grid cells naturally, and controlling which is on top using `z-index`.

---

# Question: What grid-area values would position an item from row 2 to 4 and column 4 to 6?

**Answer:** `grid-area: 2 / 4 / 4 / 6;`

---

# Question: How do you ensure an item appears on top of others in CSS Grid?

**Answer:** Use `z-index: 1` or any higher value to bring it above other elements.

---

# Question: What happens if you place an item in the grid when all defined cells are already occupied?

**Answer:** The grid automatically creates a new row, forming an **implicit grid**.

---

# Question: Why might a new item in an implicit grid appear smaller than other grid items?

**Answer:** Because implicit grids don’t inherit the sizing defined in `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`.

---

# Question: How can you control the size of newly added rows in an implicit grid?

**Answer:** Use the `grid-auto-rows` property on the container, e.g., `grid-auto-rows: 100px;`

---

# Question: What does the `grid-auto-flow: column;` property do?

**Answer:** It changes the direction of implicit grid creation from rows (default) to columns.

---

# Question: How can you set the size of implicit columns when `grid-auto-flow` is set to `column`?

**Answer:** Use `grid-auto-columns`, e.g., `grid-auto-columns: 100px;`

---

# Question: What units can be used inside `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`?

**Answer:** Pixels (`px`), ems (`em`), root ems (`rem`), percentages (`%`), and fractional units (`fr`).

---

# Question: What does the `fr` unit in CSS Grid represent?

**Answer:** A fractional portion of the available space in the grid container.

---

# Question: What happens if you define three columns with `1fr 1fr 1fr`?

**Answer:** The available space is divided equally among the three columns.

---

# Question: How does changing one of the `fr` values affect column widths?

**Answer:** The column with a higher `fr` value will occupy a larger portion of the available space. For example, `1fr 2fr 1fr` gives the second column twice as much width as the others.

---

# Question: Can you mix `fr` units with other units like `px` or `%` in the same grid definition?

**Answer:** Yes, `fr` units can be mixed with other units without issues.

---

# Question: How can you set a minimum and maximum width for a grid column?

**Answer:** Use the `minmax()` function in `grid-template-columns`, where the first argument is the minimum size and the second is the maximum, e.g., `minmax(100px, 3fr)`.

---

# Question: What problem does `minmax()` solve in CSS Grid layouts?

**Answer:** It prevents items from becoming too small by enforcing a minimum size while still allowing them to grow up to a maximum size.

---

# Question: What is the syntax for repeating values in CSS Grid using the `repeat()` function?

**Answer:** `repeat(n, value)`, where `n` is the number of times to repeat the `value`. For example, `repeat(2, 100px)` creates two 100px rows.

---

# Question: What is the benefit of using the `repeat()` function in grid templates?

**Answer:** It reduces repetition in code and improves readability by avoiding manually repeating the same value multiple times.

---

# Question: How do you add space between grid rows and columns using one value?

**Answer:** Use the `grid-gap` property with a single value, e.g., `grid-gap: 10px;`, which applies equally to rows and columns.

---

# Question: What happens when you assign two values to the `grid-gap` property?

**Answer:** The first value is applied to row gaps, and the second is applied to column gaps, e.g., `grid-gap: 10px 20px;`.

---

# Question: How does each line of `grid-template-areas` correspond to the layout?

**Answer:** Each set of single quotes represents a row, and each word inside them represents a column. For example:

```css
grid-template-areas:
  'header header'
  'main aside'
  'footer footer';
```

---

# Question: How do you assign a grid item to a named section using `grid-template-areas`?

**Answer:** Use the `grid-area` property on the item, assigning it a name like `grid-area: header;`, which corresponds to a name in `grid-template-areas`.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of using `grid-template-areas` in CSS Grid?

**Answer:** It provides a more readable and declarative way to position items in the grid without needing to track line numbers.

---

# Question: How do you determine how many sets of single quotes to use in `grid-template-areas`?

**Answer:** Match the number of sets of quotes to the number of rows defined in `grid-template-rows`.

---

# Question: How many values should be inside each set of quotes in `grid-template-areas`?

**Answer:** Match the number of values to the number of columns defined in `grid-template-columns`.

---

# Question: What visual feedback does the browser give when using `grid-template-areas`?

**Answer:** Developer tools will display the named areas in the layout, showing how elements are mapped visually based on the assigned names.

---

# Question: How would you structure `grid-template-areas` for a 3-row, 2-column layout with a header, main content, aside, and footer?

**Answer:**

```css
grid-template-areas:
  'header header'
  'main aside'
  'footer footer';
```

---

# Question: What does each named area in `grid-template-areas` represent?

**Answer:** Each name (e.g., `header`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`) corresponds to a section of the grid that you can assign to a grid item using `grid-area`.

---

# Question: Is it recommended to use a single grid for the entire webpage?

**Answer:** No, in practice it's better to use multiple grids across different sections and components of the page.

---






















# Question: What does CSS stand for?

**Answer:**
*CSS* stands for *Cascading Style Sheets*. It is used to control the layout and design of web pages.

---

# Question: What can you do with CSS?

**Answer:**
With *CSS*, you can style text with eye-catching headlines, drop caps, and borders, arrange images precisely, create columns and banners, highlight links with rollover effects, and apply dynamic behaviors like fading elements, moving objects, or animating buttons on mouse hover.

---

# Question: Is CSS difficult to use?

**Answer:**
No. Despite its powerful features, *CSS* is designed to streamline the process of styling web pages, making it easier and more efficient to use.

---

# Question: What is the relationship between HTML and CSS?

**Answer:**
*HTML* provides the structural framework of a web page, such as organizing content into headers, paragraphs, and lists. *CSS*, on the other hand, works with the browser to style and visually enhance that structure.

---

# Question: How does CSS enhance a heading created with HTML?

**Answer:**
*CSS* can format an HTML heading by applying styles such as making the text big, bold, red, and positioning it 50 pixels from the left edge of the window.

---

# Question: What is a “style” in CSS?

**Answer:**
A *style* in CSS is a rule that defines how a particular element on a web page should look, such as its font, color, spacing, or position.

---

# Question: What is a style sheet?
**Answer:**
A *style sheet* is a collection of CSS styles (rules) that collectively determine the appearance of an HTML document.

---

# Question: How can CSS be used to style images?

**Answer:**
*CSS* can align images along the edges of a web page (such as the right edge), add colorful borders around them, and place margins (like a 50-pixel space) between the image and surrounding text.

---

# Question: What elements can CSS styles be applied to?

**Answer:**
*CSS* styles can be applied to various elements on a web page including text, images, headings, paragraphs, and other HTML elements.

---

# Question: How can CSS be used with HTML tags?

**Answer:**
You can create CSS styles specifically for HTML tags, such as making all `<h1>` tags on a site share the same font, size, and formatting, ensuring consistent styling across all pages.

---

# Question: What limitations did web designers face before CSS?

**Answer:**
Before *CSS*, web designers were restricted to HTML's basic formatting options, which made web pages look plain and often required complex, bulky code to achieve decent layout and styling.

---

# Question: What are some key advantages of CSS over HTML?

**Answer:**
*CSS* offers more formatting choices, such as magazine-style paragraphs, control over line spacing (leading), background image tiling, and compact styling code compared to HTML’s heavy tags like `<font>`. CSS also helps pages load faster and makes updates easier.

---

# Question: How does CSS handle background images better than HTML?

**Answer:**
*CSS* allows you to add background images and control whether and how they tile (repeat), a feature HTML does not support.

---

# Question: Why does using CSS result in faster-loading web pages?

**Answer:**
*CSS* reduces file size by replacing bulky HTML formatting tags with compact style rules. This trimming of kilobytes leads to quicker page loads, especially on text-heavy websites.

---

# Question: How does CSS simplify site-wide updates?

**Answer:**
By collecting all styles in a single external *style sheet* and linking it to every page, changes made to one style automatically apply across all linked pages, allowing for quick, global updates to a site’s appearance.

---

# Question: Can CSS work without HTML?

**Answer:**
No. *CSS* cannot function on its own—it requires *HTML* to define the structure of the web page it styles.

---

# Question: What should you know before learning CSS?

**Answer:**
You should know how to create a web page using basic *HTML*, as CSS depends on it to apply styling.

---

# Question: What should you do if your HTML knowledge is rusty?

**Answer:**
If your HTML skills are rusty, you can refresh them using online tutorials like [HTMLDog](https://www.htmldog.com/guides/htmlbeginner) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html), or consult books like *Creating a Website: The Missing Manual* or *Head First HTML and CSS*.

---

# Question: What does HTML stand for?

**Answer:**
*HTML* stands for *Hypertext Markup Language*. It uses simple tags to define the parts of a web page.

---

# Question: What does the following HTML code represent?

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hey, I am the title of this web page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hey, I am a paragraph on this web page.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Answer:**
This is a complete basic *HTML* web page that includes a doctype declaration, an `<html>` element, a `<head>` with metadata and title, and a `<body>` with content—in this case, a paragraph.

---

# Question: What is a doctype in HTML?

**Answer:**
A *doctype* is a line of code at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the version (or flavor) of HTML being used, such as HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0.

---

# Question: What are some common HTML doctypes?

**Answer:**
Common *HTML* doctypes include *HTML 4.01* and *XHTML 1.0*, each available in two styles: *strict* and *transitional*. An example is:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

---

# Question: What is the simplified doctype used in HTML5?

**Answer:**
The simplified *HTML5* doctype is:

```html
<!doctype html>
```

It is supported by all major browsers, including older ones like Internet Explorer 6.

---

# Question: Why is the HTML5 doctype preferred over older doctypes?

**Answer:**
*HTML5* is easier to use, more streamlined, and widely supported. It avoids the complexity of earlier doctypes like HTML 4.01 and XHTML and is the future of web development.

---

# Question: Do all browsers support HTML5 features equally?

**Answer:**
No. While older browsers like Internet Explorer 6 and 8 support the *HTML5 doctype*, they do **not** recognize all *HTML5 tags* or features. Styling HTML5 tags in these browsers often requires additional *JavaScript*.

---

# Question: Why must every HTML page include a doctype?

**Answer:**
Including a *doctype* ensures consistent rendering across different browsers. Without it, browsers may display CSS inconsistently, causing your page to look different depending on the visitor’s browser.

---

# Question: What is the HTML 4.01 syntax for a line break?

**Answer:**
In *HTML 4.01*, a line break is written as:

```html
<br>
```

---

# Question: What is the XHTML syntax for a line break?

**Answer:**
In *XHTML*, a line break is written as:

```html
<br />
```

---

# Question: How does HTML5 handle line break syntax?

**Answer:**
*HTML5* is flexible and accepts **both** `<br>` and `<br />` as valid syntax for line breaks.

---

# Question: What do HTML tags do?

**Answer:**
*HTML tags* are instructions enclosed in brackets that tell the browser how to display content. They are the "markup" part of *Hypertext Markup Language*.

---

# Question: What is the structure of most HTML tags?

**Answer:**
Most HTML tags come in *pairs*: an opening tag (e.g., `<p>`) and a closing tag (e.g., `</p>`). The closing tag includes a forward slash `/`.

---

# Question: What are the four essential elements found in every HTML page?

**Answer:**
The four essential elements are:

1. The *DOCTYPE* declaration.
2. The opening `<html>` tag.
3. The closing `</html>` tag.
4. Content wrapped in HTML structure tags like `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`.

--

# Question: What does the `<html>` tag represent in a web page?

**Answer:**
The `<html>` tag indicates that the content is written in HTML. It encloses all other content and tags in a web page, making it the "root" of the page structure.

---

# Question: What are the two main sections within the `<html>` tag?

**Answer:**

1. The `<head>` section
2. The `<body>` section

These are like two main branches of the HTML tree structure.

---

# Question: What does the `<head>` section of a web page contain?

**Answer:**
The `<head>` section contains:

* The page’s `<title>`
* Metadata (like a page description)
* CSS code or links to external CSS files
* Other non-visible information used by browsers and search engines

---

# Question: What does the `<body>` section of a web page contain?

**Answer:**
The `<body>` section contains all the visible content of the web page, such as:

* Headlines
* Text
* Images
* Paragraphs
* Links

---

# Question: Which tag is used to define a paragraph?

**Answer:**
The `<p>` tag is used to start a paragraph, and the `</p>` tag is used to end it.

---

# Question: What does the `<strong>` tag do?

**Answer:**
The `<strong>` tag is used to emphasize text. It makes the enclosed text appear in **bold**.

---

# Question: How is a hyperlink created in HTML?

**Answer:**
Using the `<a>` (anchor) tag. For example:

```html
<a href="http://www.example.com">Click here!</a>
```

---

# Question: What is an attribute in an HTML tag?

**Answer:**
An attribute provides extra information about an element. In `<a href="http://...">`, `href` is the attribute and the URL is its value.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the `href` attribute?

**Answer:**
The `href` attribute in an `<a>` tag specifies the destination URL of the hyperlink.

---

# Question: Why was XHTML introduced?

**Answer:**
XHTML was introduced to enforce stricter rules on HTML. It requires:

* Lowercase tag names
* Properly nested and closed tags

This improves compatibility with browsers, mobile devices, and other web technologies.

---

# Question: What are some issues with standard (older) HTML?

**Answer:**
Standard HTML:

* Allows mixed-case tags (`<BODY>`, `<body>`, etc.)
* Permits unclosed tags (e.g., `<p>` without `</p>`)
  This makes HTML easier to write but harder for browsers and smart devices to interpret consistently.

---

# Question: What is xHTML and why was it introduced?

**Answer:**
xHTML, or Extensible HyperText Markup Language, was introduced around 2000 as an improved version of HTML to keep pace with the rise of XML (Extensible Markup Language). It is essentially an "XML-ified" version of HTML intended to be the future standard for web pages by combining HTML's features with XML's stricter syntax rules.

---

# Question: Why did the W3C move away from xHTML towards HTML5?

**Answer:**
The W3C moved away from xHTML because the complexity of fully adopting XML as the web's prime language made browser manufacturers reluctant to follow that path. As a result, the W3C closed the xHTML working group and developed HTML5 instead, which moves away from XML and back to an enhanced version of HTML, supported by all major browsers.

---

# Question: How is HTML5 different from xHTML in terms of its approach to web development?

**Answer:**
Unlike xHTML, which aimed to foster a new way to build web pages with strict XML rules, HTML5 focuses on ensuring the Web continues to work as it always has, maintaining the basics of HTML while adding new elements to support modern web design practices without requiring XML compliance.

---

# Question: What are some new tags introduced in HTML5, and what purposes do they serve?

**Answer:**
HTML5 introduced new semantic tags such as:

* `<header>`: contains content typically found at the top of a page, like logos and navigation links.
* `<nav>`: encloses navigation links for the site.
* `<footer>`: holds content usually placed at the bottom of the page, such as legal notices or contact information.
  Additionally, HTML5 adds tags to embed video and audio, and enhanced form tags with features like sliders, pop-up date pickers, and built-in form validation.

—--

# Question: What challenges are associated with using HTML5's new features?

**Answer:**
Browser support for many new HTML5 features is inconsistent, making it difficult to use them without elaborate workarounds. Older browsers, such as Internet Explorer 8 and earlier, require additional help to properly render HTML5 elements.

—--

# Question: Should developers start using HTML5 now, even though it is not fully supported?

**Answer:**
Yes, developers are encouraged to start using the HTML5 doctype and basic HTML5 elements now, despite some browser compatibility issues, especially with older browsers. HTML5 is widely supported by modern browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox and is becoming the new standard for web development.

—--

# Question: What basic software do you need to create web pages using HTML and CSS?

**Answer:**
You only need a basic text editor like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac to create web pages made up of HTML and CSS.

—--

# Question: Why might you want to use software other than basic text editors for web development?

**Answer:**
After typing a few hundred lines of HTML and CSS, basic editors can become cumbersome. Specialized software offers features like syntax highlighting, FTP support, and auto-completion that make writing, editing, and managing web pages easier and more efficient.

—--

# Question: Name three free programs for editing HTML and CSS, and one key feature of each.

**Answer:**

* **jEdit** (Windows, Mac, Linux): Java-based and includes syntax highlighting.
* **Notepad++** (Windows): Fast text editor with syntax highlighting to color code HTML and CSS elements.
* **TextWrangler** (Mac): Pared-down version of BBEdit with syntax highlighting and FTP support for uploading files.

—--

# Question: What is the difference between TextWrangler and BBEdit?

**Answer:**
TextWrangler is a free, simplified version of BBEdit. While it lacks some of BBEdit’s built-in HTML tools, it still offers syntax highlighting and FTP capabilities.

—--

# Question: What was introduced in CSS 1, and when was it released?

**Answer:**
CSS 1, introduced in 1996, laid the groundwork for Cascading Style Sheets by establishing the basic structure of styles and the selector concept, along with most of the core CSS properties covered in this book.

—--

# Question: What are some key features added in CSS 2?

**Answer:**
CSS 2 added features such as the ability to target different devices (like printers and monitors), new selectors, and precise positioning of elements on a web page.

—--

# Question: What is CSS 2.1, and how does it relate to CSS 2?

**Answer:**
CSS 2.1 is the current accepted standard that incorporates all of CSS 1, adds several new properties, and corrects some problems found in the CSS 2 guidelines. It is a minor update rather than a radical change from CSS 2, and most browsers have adapted to it smoothly.

—--

# Question: How is CSS3 different from previous versions like CSS 1 and CSS 2.1?

**Answer:**
Unlike previous versions, CSS3 is not a single standard but a collection of separate modules (e.g., Selectors, Values and Units, Box Alignment). Each module develops independently, meaning there is no unified "CSS3" standard. Different modules are at various stages of completion and browser support.

—--

# Question: What is the status of CSS4?

**Answer:**
There will be no single CSS4. Instead, new versions of different CSS modules will continue to be developed and updated independently at different levels.

—--

# Question: How does adding CSS change the way HTML is used on web pages?

**Answer:**
Adding CSS to web design eliminates the need to repurpose awkward HTML tags just to achieve visual effects. It makes writing HTML easier and more semantic by separating content structure from presentation, allowing the use of simpler and cleaner HTML code.

—--

# Question: What happens to old HTML tags like the <font> tag when using CSS-driven web design?

**Answer:**
Old HTML tags and attributes like the <font> tag become obsolete and can be forgotten completely because CSS handles styling and visual effects.

---

# Question: Compare the size and complexity of an HTML-only page to a CSS-styled page with a similar look.

**Answer:**
An HTML-only page with visual effects can be nearly four times larger in file size and contain about three times more lines of code than a CSS-styled page achieving the same look. For example, an HTML-only page might be 14k with 213 lines of code, whereas the CSS version is only 4k with 71 lines.

---

# Question: Why was HTML originally created, and what was its primary purpose?

**Answer:**
HTML was originally created by scientists to structure technical documentation for easy comprehension, not for visual design. Its primary purpose was to organize information logically and semantically, such as using <h1> for main headings and <h2> for subheadings.

---
