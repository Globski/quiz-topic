By calling the `toLong()` function on the `Int` variable, e.g., `val y: Long = x.toLong()`.

---

# Question: What are operators in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, with operands being the values involved in the operation.

---

# Question: What are the four main groups of Kotlin operators?

**Answer:**
The four main groups are Arithmetic operators, Assignment operators, Comparison operators, and Logical operators.

---

# Question: Name at least three arithmetic operators in Kotlin and their functions.

**Answer:**

* `+` Addition: adds two values
* `-` Subtraction: subtracts one value from another
* `*` Multiplication: multiplies two values
* `/` Division: divides one value by another
* `%` Modulus: returns the remainder of division
* `++` Increment: increases a value by 1
* `--` Decrement: decreases a value by 1

---

# Question: What does the assignment operator `+=` do?

**Answer:**
The `+=` operator adds a value to a variable and assigns the result back to that variable (e.g., `x += 5` is equivalent to `x = x + 5`).

---

# Question: How does the comparison operator `!=` work?

**Answer:**
The `!=` operator checks if two values are not equal and returns `true` if they are different, otherwise `false`.

---

# Question: What does the logical operator `&&` (Logical and) do?

**Answer:**
The `&&` operator returns `true` only if both conditions on its sides are `true`.

---

# Question: What is the function of the logical NOT operator `!`?

**Answer:**
The `!` operator reverses the result of a Boolean expression, returning `false` if the expression is `true`, and vice versa.

---

# Question: Give an example of using the modulus operator `%` in Kotlin.

**Answer:**
Example: `val remainder = 10 % 3` results in `remainder` being `1`, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

---

# Question: How do you declare a string variable in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You can declare a string variable by assigning text surrounded by double quotes, for example: `var greeting = "Hello"`. Specifying the type explicitly as `String` is optional.

---

# Question: How do you access the first and third characters in a Kotlin string?

**Answer:**
Use the index inside square brackets, starting at 0. For example, `txt[0]` accesses the first character, and `txt[2]` accesses the third character.

---

# Question: How do you find the length of a string in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Use the `length` property on the string object, for example: `txt.length`.

---

# Question: What do the functions `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` do?

**Answer:**
`toUpperCase()` converts all characters in the string to uppercase; `toLowerCase()` converts all characters to lowercase.

---

# Question: How does the `compareTo()` function work when comparing two strings?

**Answer:**
It compares two strings and returns `0` if they are equal.

---

# Question: What does the `indexOf()` function return?

**Answer:**
It returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a specified substring within a string, counting from zero.

---

# Question: How can you include quotes inside a Kotlin string?

**Answer:**
Use single quotes `'` inside a double-quoted string, for example: `var txt = "It's alright"`.

---

# Question: How do you concatenate two strings in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You can use the `+` operator or the `plus()` function. For example: `"John" + " " + "Doe"` or `"John ".plus("Doe")`.

---

# Question: What is a string template in Kotlin and how is it used?

**Answer:**
A string template allows embedding variables or expressions inside a string using the `$` symbol, e.g., `println("My name is $firstName $lastName")`.

---

# Question: What values can a Boolean variable in Kotlin hold?

**Answer:**
A Boolean variable can only hold `true` or `false`.

---

# Question: How do you declare a Boolean variable with an explicit type in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You declare it using the `Boolean` keyword, for example: `val isKotlinFun: Boolean = true`.

---

# Question: Can Kotlin infer the type of a Boolean variable if not explicitly specified?

**Answer:**
Yes, Kotlin can infer the type, so you can write: `val isKotlinFun = true`.

---

# Question: What does a Boolean expression return?

**Answer:**
It returns a Boolean value: `true` or `false`.

---

# Question: Give an example of a Boolean expression using the greater than operator.

**Answer:**
`println(10 > 9)` which returns `true`.

---

# Question: What will `println(x == 10)` return if `x` is declared as `val x = 10`?

**Answer:**
It will return `true` because `x` is equal to 10.

---

# Question: What will `println(10 == 15)` output?

**Answer:**
It will output `false` because 10 is not equal to 15.

---

# Question: What logical conditions does Kotlin support for comparisons?

**Answer:**
Kotlin supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

* Less than: `a < b`
* Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
* Greater than: `a > b`
* Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
* Equal to: `a == b`
* Not equal to: `a != b`

---

# Question: What is the basic syntax to use an `if` statement in Kotlin?

**Answer:**

```kotlin
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

The keyword `if` must be lowercase.

---

# Question: How do you use an `else` block in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You use `else` to specify a block of code that executes if the `if` condition is false:

```kotlin
if (condition) {
  // executes if condition is true
} else {
  // executes if condition is false
}
```

---

# Question: What does the `else if` statement do in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
`else if` allows testing a new condition if the previous `if` condition is false:

```kotlin
if (condition1) {
  // executes if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // executes if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

---

# Question: How can Kotlin’s `if..else` be used differently from Java’s?

**Answer:**
In Kotlin, `if..else` can be used both as a statement and as an expression to assign a value to a variable, whereas in Java, `if..else` is typically used only as a statement.

---

# Question: Show an example of using `if` as an expression in Kotlin to assign a value.

**Answer:**

```kotlin
val time = 20
val greeting = if (time < 18) {
  "Good day."
} else {
  "Good evening."
}
println(greeting)
```

The variable `greeting` gets a value based on the condition.

---

# Question: Is the `else` block required when using `if` as an expression in Kotlin? Why?

**Answer:**
Yes, `else` is required when using `if` as an expression because every possible condition must return a value to assign to the variable.

---

# Question: Can you omit curly braces `{}` in Kotlin `if` statements? Under what condition?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can omit curly braces `{}` if the `if` or `else` block contains only a single statement.

---

# Question: What will the following Kotlin code output?

```kotlin
val time = 22
if (time < 10) {
  println("Good morning.")
} else if (time < 20) {
  println("Good day.")
} else {
  println("Good evening.")
}
```

**Answer:**
It will output:

```
Good evening.
```

Because `time` (22) is greater than both 10 and 20, the else block executes.

---

# Question: What error will occur if you write `If` or `IF` instead of `if` in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
An error will occur because Kotlin keywords are case-sensitive; `if` must be lowercase.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the Kotlin `when` expression?

**Answer:**
The `when` expression is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed, providing an easier-to-read alternative to multiple `if..else` expressions.

---

# Question: How does the `when` expression work internally?

**Answer:**

* The `when` variable is evaluated once.
* Its value is compared with each branch’s value.
* Each branch has a value followed by an arrow `->` and a result.
* When a match is found, the corresponding block is executed.
* The `else` branch runs if no match is found.

---

# Question: Write a Kotlin `when` expression that returns the weekday name for the day number stored in variable `day`.

**Answer:**

```kotlin
val result = when (day) {
  1 -> "Monday"
  2 -> "Tuesday"
  3 -> "Wednesday"
  4 -> "Thursday"
  5 -> "Friday"
  6 -> "Saturday"
  7 -> "Sunday"
  else -> "Invalid day."
}
```

---

# Question: What will be the output if `day` equals 4 in the `when` example?

**Answer:**
The output will be:

```
Thursday
```

---

# Question: What is the Kotlin `when` expression similar to in Java?

**Answer:**
The Kotlin `when` expression is similar to the `switch` statement in Java.

---

# Question: What happens if no branch in a `when` expression matches the variable's value and there is no `else` branch?

**Answer:**
The code will not compile because `when` requires an `else` branch to handle unmatched cases, unless all possible cases are covered.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of loops in programming?

**Answer:**
Loops execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true, helping save time, reduce errors, and make code more readable.

---

# Question: What is the syntax of a `while` loop in Kotlin?

**Answer:**

```kotlin
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

---

# Question: In the `while` loop example below, what is the output?

```kotlin
var i = 0
while (i < 5) {
  println(i)
  i++
}
```

**Answer:**
The output will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

# Question: Why is it important to increase the variable inside a `while` loop?

**Answer:**
If the variable is not increased, the condition will never become false, causing an infinite loop.

---

# Question: What is the difference between a `while` loop and a `do..while` loop in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
A `while` loop checks the condition before executing the code block, so it may not execute at all if the condition is false initially.
A `do..while` loop executes the code block once before checking the condition, ensuring the block runs at least once.

---

# Question: What is the syntax of a `do..while` loop in Kotlin?

**Answer:**

```kotlin
do {
  // code block to be executed
} while (condition)
```

---

# Question: What will the following Kotlin code output?

```kotlin
var i = 0
do {
  println(i)
  i++
} while (i < 5)
```

**Answer:**
The output will be:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

---

# Question: Can a `do..while` loop run even if the condition is false initially? Explain.

**Answer:**
Yes, because the code block in a `do..while` loop executes before the condition is tested, it runs at least once regardless of the condition.

---

# Question: What does the `break` statement do in a Kotlin loop?

**Answer:**
The `break` statement immediately exits the loop, stopping any further iterations.

---

# Question: In the example below, when does the loop stop executing?

```kotlin
var i = 0
while (i < 10) {
  println(i)
  i++
  if (i == 4) {
    break
  }
}
```

**Answer:**
The loop stops executing when `i` becomes equal to 4, so the output will include values from 0 to 3.

---

# Question: What does the `continue` statement do in a Kotlin loop?

**Answer:**
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration of the loop and proceeds with the next iteration.

---

# Question: In the example below, which value is skipped during the loop?

```kotlin
var i = 0
while (i < 10) {
  if (i == 4) {
    i++
    continue
  }
  println(i)
  i++
}
```

**Answer:**
The value `4` is skipped and not printed.

---

# Question: Why is `i++` called before `continue` in the example with `continue`?

**Answer:**
Because `continue` skips the rest of the loop body, `i++` must be called before `continue` to avoid an infinite loop.

---

# Question: How do you create an array in Kotlin with the values "Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", and "Mazda"?

**Answer:**
Use the `arrayOf()` function with comma-separated values:

```kotlin
val cars = arrayOf("Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda")

  // code to execute for each element x
}
```

---

# Question: Write a Kotlin `for` loop that prints all elements in the array `cars = arrayOf("Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda")`.

**Answer:**

```kotlin
val cars = arrayOf("Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda")
for (x in cars) {
  println(x)
}
```

---

# Question: Can the Kotlin `for` loop be used to iterate over arrays of types other than strings? Give an example.

**Answer:**
Yes. For example, iterating over an array of integers:

```kotlin
val nums = arrayOf(1, 5, 10, 15, 20)
for (x in nums) {
  println(x)
}
```

---

# Question: Does Kotlin have the traditional for loop syntax found in Java (e.g., for(init; condition; increment))?

**Answer:**
No, Kotlin does not have the traditional for loop syntax. Instead, it uses the `for` loop to iterate over arrays, ranges, or other iterable collections.

---

# Question: What kinds of collections or data can Kotlin's `for` loop iterate over?

**Answer:**
Kotlin's `for` loop can iterate over arrays, ranges, and other collections or objects that contain a countable number of values.

---

# Question: How do you create a range of characters from 'a' to 'x' in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Use the `..` operator to create a range:

```kotlin
for (chars in 'a'..'x') {
  println(chars)
}
```

---

# Question: Does a Kotlin range include both the first and last values?

**Answer:**
Yes, ranges include both the start and the end values.

---

# Question: How do you create a range of numbers from 5 to 15 in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Use the `..` operator in a for loop:

```kotlin
for (nums in 5..15) {
  println(nums)
}
```

---

# Question: How can you check if a value exists in an array using Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Use the `in` operator to check if the value is contained in the array:

```kotlin
if (value in array) {
  // it exists
}
```

---

# Question: What will the following code do?

```kotlin
for (nums in 5..15) {
  if (nums == 10) {
    break
  }
  println(nums)
}
```

**Answer:**
It will print numbers from 5 up to 9 and then stop the loop when `nums` equals 10.

---

# Question: What will the following code do?

```kotlin
for (nums in 5..15) {
  if (nums == 10) {
    continue
  }
  println(nums)
}
```

**Answer:**
It will print all numbers from 5 to 15 except it will skip printing 10.

---

# Question: Can you use `break` and `continue` statements inside a Kotlin range-based `for` loop?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can use both `break` to exit the loop early and `continue` to skip the current iteration.

---

# Question: What keyword is used to declare a function in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
The `fun` keyword is used to declare a function.

---

# Question: How do you define a simple function named `myFunction` that prints "I just got executed!"?

**Answer:**

# Question: What does OOP stand for?

**Answer:**
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

---

# Question: How does procedural programming differ from object-oriented programming?

**Answer:**
Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on data, while object-oriented programming focuses on creating objects that contain both data and methods.

---

# Question: Name one advantage of object-oriented programming over procedural programming.

**Answer:**
OOP is faster and easier to execute.

---

# Question: What does the DRY principle stand for, and why is it important in OOP?

**Answer:**
DRY stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." It is important because it reduces code repetition by extracting common code into a single place for reuse, making the code easier to maintain, modify, and debug.

---

# Question: What are the two main aspects of object-oriented programming?

**Answer:**
The two main aspects of OOP are classes and objects.

---

# Question: What is a class in Kotlin OOP?

**Answer:**
A class is a template for objects.

---

# Question: What is an object in Kotlin OOP?

**Answer:**
An object is an instance of a class.

---

# Question: When individual objects are created from a class, what do they inherit?

**Answer:**
They inherit all the variables and methods from the class.

---

# Question: What is everything in Kotlin associated with?

**Answer:**
Everything in Kotlin is associated with classes and objects, along with their properties and functions.

---

# Question: What is a class in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
A class is like an object constructor or a blueprint for creating objects.

---

# Question: In the context of Kotlin, what is a property?

**Answer:**
A property is a variable that belongs to a class.

---

# Question: What keyword is used to define a class in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
The `class` keyword is used to define a class.

---

# Question: According to best practices, how should you name a class in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
It is good practice to start the name of a class with an uppercase letter.

---

# Question: How do you create an object from a class in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You create an object by using the class name followed by parentheses. For example: `val c1 = Car()`.

---

# Question: How do you access or modify an object’s property in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You use the dot syntax (`.`), such as `c1.brand = "Ford"` or `println(c1.brand)`.

---

# Question: Can you create multiple objects from a single Kotlin class?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can create multiple objects from one class, each with its own property values.

---

# Question: What will the following line output: `println(c1.brand)` after `c1.brand = "Ford"`?

**Answer:**
It will output `Ford`.

---

# Question: What is a constructor in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
A constructor is a special function used to initialize properties of a class when an object is created.

---

# Question: How do you define a constructor in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You define a constructor by placing parentheses `()` after the class name and specifying the properties with their types inside the parentheses.

---

# Question: What does this Kotlin code do: `val c1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang", 1969)`?

**Answer:**
It creates an object `c1` of the `Car` class and initializes its `brand`, `model`, and `year` properties using the constructor.

---

# Question: What is the benefit of using a constructor in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Using a constructor allows you to initialize object properties more quickly and cleanly, reducing repetitive code.

---

# Question: How are properties passed into a constructor different from properties defined inside the class body?

**Answer:**
Properties passed into a constructor are initialized at object creation time, while properties defined inside the class body need to be manually assigned after object creation.

---

# Question: Write the syntax for defining a Kotlin class with three properties: `brand`, `model`, and `year`, using a constructor.

**Answer:**
`class Car(var brand: String, var model: String, var year: Int)`

---

# Question: How would you create multiple objects of a class using a constructor in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
By calling the class constructor with different arguments, e.g.:

```kotlin
val c1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang", 1969)  
val c2 = Car("BMW", "X5", 1999)
```

---

# Question: What will the following Kotlin code output if we print `c3.brand`?

```kotlin
val c3 = Car("Tesla", "Model S", 2020)
println(c3.brand)
```

**Answer:**
It will output: `Tesla`.

---

# Question: What is a class function in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
A class function, also known as a member function, is a function defined inside a class that performs a specific action related to that class.

---

# Question: How do you define a function inside a Kotlin class?

**Answer:**
You define a function inside a Kotlin class using the `fun` keyword, followed by the function name and its body.

---

# Question: What happens when an object of a class is created in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
When an object is created, it has access to all the properties and functions (including class functions) defined in the class.

---

# Question: In Kotlin, how would you call the `drive()` function on an object `c1` of class `Car`?

**Answer:**
You would call it using dot syntax: `c1.drive()`

---

# Question: What will the following code print?

```kotlin
class Car(var brand: String, var model: String, var year: Int) {
  fun drive() {
    println("Wrooom!")
  }
}

val c1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang", 1969)
c1.drive()
```

**Answer:**
It will print: `Wrooom!`

---

# Question: What is inheritance in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Inheritance in Kotlin allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and functions from another class (superclass), promoting code reusability.

---

# Question: What is a superclass in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
A superclass (or parent class) is the class being inherited from.

---

# Question: What is a subclass in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
A subclass (or child class) is the class that inherits properties and functions from another class.

---

# Question: Which keyword is used to allow a Kotlin class to be inherited?

**Answer:**
The `open` keyword is used before a class definition to allow it to be inherited.

---

# Question: How do you define that a class inherits from another in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You define it by placing a colon `:` after the subclass name, followed by the superclass name. Example: `class MyChildClass : MyParentClass()`

---

# Question: What will the following code output?

```kotlin
open class MyParentClass {
  val x = 5
}

class MyChildClass : MyParentClass() {
  fun myFunction() {
    println(x)
  }
}

fun main() {
  val myObj = MyChildClass()
  myObj.myFunction()
}
```

**Answer:**
It will output: `5`

---

# Question: Why is inheritance useful in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Inheritance is useful for code reusability, allowing you to reuse properties and functions of an existing class when creating new classes.

---

# Question: What happens if you try to inherit from a class in Kotlin without marking it as `open`?

**Answer:**
You will get a compilation error because, by default, Kotlin classes are `final` and cannot be inherited unless marked `open`.

---


# Question: Can you pass parameters to a class function in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Yes, just like regular functions, you can pass parameters to a class function.

---

# Question: What does the following Kotlin function do?

```kotlin
fun speed(maxSpeed: Int) {
  println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed)
}
```

**Answer:**
It prints the maximum speed passed to it as an argument.

---

# Question: Write the correct way to call the `speed()` function with a value of `200` on an object `c1` of the `Car` class.

**Answer:**
`c1.speed(200)`
