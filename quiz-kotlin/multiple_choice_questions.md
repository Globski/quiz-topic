---

# Question: What are operators in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values, with operands being the values involved in the operation.

---

# Question: What are the four main groups of Kotlin operators?

**Answer:**
The four main groups are Arithmetic operators, Assignment operators, Comparison operators, and Logical operators.

---

# Question: Name at least three arithmetic operators in Kotlin and their functions.

**Answer:**

* `+` Addition: adds two values
* `-` Subtraction: subtracts one value from another
* `*` Multiplication: multiplies two values
* `/` Division: divides one value by another
* `%` Modulus: returns the remainder of division
* `++` Increment: increases a value by 1
* `--` Decrement: decreases a value by 1

---

# Question: What does the assignment operator `+=` do?

**Answer:**
The `+=` operator adds a value to a variable and assigns the result back to that variable (e.g., `x += 5` is equivalent to `x = x + 5`).

---

# Question: How does the comparison operator `!=` work?

**Answer:**
The `!=` operator checks if two values are not equal and returns `true` if they are different, otherwise `false`.

---

# Question: What does the logical operator `&&` (Logical and) do?

**Answer:**
The `&&` operator returns `true` only if both conditions on its sides are `true`.

---

# Question: What is the function of the logical NOT operator `!`?

**Answer:**
The `!` operator reverses the result of a Boolean expression, returning `false` if the expression is `true`, and vice versa.

---

# Question: Give an example of using the modulus operator `%` in Kotlin.

**Answer:**
Example: `val remainder = 10 % 3` results in `remainder` being `1`, because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

---

# Question: How do you declare a string variable in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You can declare a string variable by assigning text surrounded by double quotes, for example: `var greeting = "Hello"`. Specifying the type explicitly as `String` is optional.

---

# Question: How do you access the first and third characters in a Kotlin string?

**Answer:**
Use the index inside square brackets, starting at 0. For example, `txt[0]` accesses the first character, and `txt[2]` accesses the third character.

---

# Question: How do you find the length of a string in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
Use the `length` property on the string object, for example: `txt.length`.

---

# Question: What do the functions `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` do?

**Answer:**
`toUpperCase()` converts all characters in the string to uppercase; `toLowerCase()` converts all characters to lowercase.

---

# Question: How does the `compareTo()` function work when comparing two strings?

**Answer:**
It compares two strings and returns `0` if they are equal.

---

# Question: What does the `indexOf()` function return?

**Answer:**
It returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a specified substring within a string, counting from zero.

---

# Question: How can you include quotes inside a Kotlin string?

**Answer:**
Use single quotes `'` inside a double-quoted string, for example: `var txt = "It's alright"`.

---

# Question: How do you concatenate two strings in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You can use the `+` operator or the `plus()` function. For example: `"John" + " " + "Doe"` or `"John ".plus("Doe")`.

---

# Question: What is a string template in Kotlin and how is it used?

**Answer:**
A string template allows embedding variables or expressions inside a string using the `$` symbol, e.g., `println("My name is $firstName $lastName")`.

---

# Question: What values can a Boolean variable in Kotlin hold?

**Answer:**
A Boolean variable can only hold `true` or `false`.

---

# Question: How do you declare a Boolean variable with an explicit type in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You declare it using the `Boolean` keyword, for example: `val isKotlinFun: Boolean = true`.

---

# Question: Can Kotlin infer the type of a Boolean variable if not explicitly specified?

**Answer:**
Yes, Kotlin can infer the type, so you can write: `val isKotlinFun = true`.

---

# Question: What does a Boolean expression return?

**Answer:**
It returns a Boolean value: `true` or `false`.

---

# Question: Give an example of a Boolean expression using the greater than operator.

**Answer:**
`println(10 > 9)` which returns `true`.

---

# Question: What will `println(x == 10)` return if `x` is declared as `val x = 10`?

**Answer:**
It will return `true` because `x` is equal to 10.

---

# Question: What will `println(10 == 15)` output?

**Answer:**
It will output `false` because 10 is not equal to 15.

---

# Question: What logical conditions does Kotlin support for comparisons?

**Answer:**
Kotlin supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

* Less than: `a < b`
* Less than or equal to: `a <= b`
* Greater than: `a > b`
* Greater than or equal to: `a >= b`
* Equal to: `a == b`
* Not equal to: `a != b`

---

# Question: What is the basic syntax to use an `if` statement in Kotlin?

**Answer:**

```kotlin
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

The keyword `if` must be lowercase.

---

# Question: How do you use an `else` block in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
You use `else` to specify a block of code that executes if the `if` condition is false:

```kotlin
if (condition) {
  // executes if condition is true
} else {
  // executes if condition is false
}
```

---

# Question: What does the `else if` statement do in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
`else if` allows testing a new condition if the previous `if` condition is false:

```kotlin
if (condition1) {
  // executes if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // executes if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // executes if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

---

# Question: How can Kotlin’s `if..else` be used differently from Java’s?

**Answer:**
In Kotlin, `if..else` can be used both as a statement and as an expression to assign a value to a variable, whereas in Java, `if..else` is typically used only as a statement.

---

# Question: Show an example of using `if` as an expression in Kotlin to assign a value.

**Answer:**

```kotlin
val time = 20
val greeting = if (time < 18) {
  "Good day."
} else {
  "Good evening."
}
println(greeting)
```

The variable `greeting` gets a value based on the condition.

---

# Question: Is the `else` block required when using `if` as an expression in Kotlin? Why?

**Answer:**
Yes, `else` is required when using `if` as an expression because every possible condition must return a value to assign to the variable.

---

# Question: Can you omit curly braces `{}` in Kotlin `if` statements? Under what condition?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can omit curly braces `{}` if the `if` or `else` block contains only a single statement.

---

# Question: What will the following Kotlin code output?

```kotlin
val time = 22
if (time < 10) {
  println("Good morning.")
} else if (time < 20) {
  println("Good day.")
} else {
  println("Good evening.")
}
```

**Answer:**
It will output:

```
Good evening.
```

Because `time` (22) is greater than both 10 and 20, the else block executes.

---

# Question: What error will occur if you write `If` or `IF` instead of `if` in Kotlin?

**Answer:**
An error will occur because Kotlin keywords are case-sensitive; `if` must be lowercase.
