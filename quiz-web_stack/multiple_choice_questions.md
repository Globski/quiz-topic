---

# Question: How does a web page without any CSS typically render on an iPhone 13?

**Answer:**
It renders like a desktop page shrunk down to fit the smaller screen because iOS renders pages at 980 px wide by default and scales them to the viewport.

---

# Question: Why did websites render poorly on mobile devices before responsive design became widespread?

Because mobile browsers displayed desktop-sized pages shrunk to fit the screen, resulting in a poor and unreadable user experience.

---

# Question: What HTML element can you add to the `<head>` to make a page more mobile-friendly?

**Answer:**
A viewport meta tag: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0" />`

---

# Question: What does the viewport meta tag instruct the browser to do?

It tells the browser to render the page content at the width of the device screen, enabling proper scaling and layout on mobile devices.

---

# Question: Is the viewport meta tag a formal web standard?

**Answer:**
No, it is not a formal standard but has become the de facto method introduced by Apple for controlling page rendering on mobile devices.


# Question: Why do web pages without CSS render poorly on devices like the iPhone 13 by default?

**Answer:**
Because iOS renders web pages at a fixed width of 980 pixels by default and shrinks them down to fit the smaller viewport, making the page appear like a desktop site scaled down, which looks unattractive and is hard to read.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the viewport meta tag in responsive web design?

**Answer:**
The viewport meta tag tells the browser how to render the page, specifically instructing it to make the content render at the width of the device’s screen, enabling better mobile-friendly layouts.

---

# Question: What does the viewport technically refer to in a browser window?

**Answer:**
The viewport is the area of a browser window where the web page is visible, excluding browser toolbars, URL bars, and other interface elements.

---

# Question: How can you make an image scale fluidly across different screen sizes using CSS?

**Answer:**
By setting `max-width: 100%;` on the image, it ensures the image will scale down to fit within its container but never exceed its original size, making it fluid across various viewport widths.

---

# Question: Why might using `width: 100%` on images cause issues compared to `max-width: 100%`?

**Answer:**
Using `width: 100%` forces the image to always stretch to fill the container, which can cause smaller images to become oversized if the container is larger than the image’s intrinsic size. In contrast, `max-width: 100%` prevents images from exceeding their natural width.

---

# Question: What problem occurs with page’s layout at viewport widths larger than 800 pixels?

**Answer:**
The layout, especially the image, begins to stretch and look distorted because the basic styles are not optimized for larger screens, requiring adjustments like resizing and repositioning elements.

---

# Question: What layout adjustments are suggested when the viewport width exceeds 800 pixels?

**Answer:**
The main hero image is limited in size and positioned on the right, while the introductory text is positioned to the left, improving the layout on larger screens.

---

# Question: What are CSS media queries and how do they help in responsive design?

**Answer:**
Media queries are CSS directives that apply styles conditionally based on environment factors like screen width, allowing the layout to change and adapt to different viewport sizes.

---

# Question: What does the term “breakpoint” mean in responsive web design?

**Answer:**
A breakpoint is a specific viewport width or height where the design should significantly change its layout or styling to better fit the screen size.

---

# Question: Why is it considered bad practice to design specifically for popular device sizes using fixed breakpoints?

**Answer:**
Because it limits responsiveness to only certain screen sizes, rather than allowing the design to adapt fluidly to any viewport size, which defeats the purpose of truly responsive design.

---

# Question: How is a minimum-width media query written in CSS?

**Answer:**
It is written as:

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
  /* styles */
}
```

This applies the enclosed styles only if the viewport is at least 800 pixels wide.

---

# Question: What is the “smallest screen first” approach in writing CSS for responsive design?

**Answer:**
It means writing the base styles for the smallest or least capable devices first, then progressively enhancing the design using media queries for larger screens.
