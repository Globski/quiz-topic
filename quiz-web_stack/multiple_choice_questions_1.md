Before the digital age, most data was stored physically (e.g., in filing cabinets or shoeboxes), making it harder to access or steal remotely. Today, digital data can be accessed or stolen from anywhere, often without the victim's immediate knowledge.

---

# Question: What is the role of encryption in computer security?

**Answer:**
Encryption is the foundation of computer security. It transforms readable data (plaintext) into unreadable data (ciphertext), which can only be decrypted by someone with the correct key.

---

# Question: What is plaintext and ciphertext in the context of encryption?

**Answer:**
Plaintext is the original, readable form of data, while ciphertext is the encrypted, unreadable form. Encryption turns plaintext into ciphertext, and decryption reverses the process.

---

# Question: Who is considered an attacker in the context of computer security?

**Answer:**
An attacker is anyone who tries to decrypt or access encrypted data without proper authorization.

---

# Question: What is the goal of encryption from a security standpoint?

**Answer:**
The goal of encryption is to ensure that authorized users can easily decrypt and access data, while making it virtually impossible for unauthorized users (attackers) to do so.

---

# Question: Why is no encryption system considered completely unbreakable?

**Answer:**
Because with enough time and computing power, any encryption system can theoretically be broken. The goal is to make decryption so difficult that it becomes impractical for attackers.

---

# Question: What is the primary goal of computer security in terms of encryption?

**Answer:**
To make attacks so resource-intensive and time-consuming that they are practically impossible to succeed, even if technically feasible.

---

# Question: Why are old, pre-software encryption techniques still relevant today?

**Answer:**
Because they form the foundational concepts upon which modern digital encryption schemes are built. Techniques like transposition still influence current encryption methods.

---

# Question: What does the term "transposition" mean in the context of encryption?

**Answer:**
Transposition refers to a method of encryption that involves rearranging the positions of characters in the plaintext to create ciphertext without altering the actual characters.

---

# Question: How does a simple transposition cipher work?

**Answer:**
A simple transposition cipher works by selecting letters from the plaintext in a specific pattern (e.g., every third letter), and rearranging them in multiple passes to obscure the original message.

---

# Question: Why were transposition ciphers useful among children passing notes?

**Answer:**
Because they could quickly scramble a message in a way that made it unreadable to others, while still being easy to reverse for the intended recipient.

---

# Question: Why is the basic transposition method considered weak encryption?

**Answer:**
Because it relies on secrecy of the method itself, which can be easily compromised if someone reveals the technique. Once the method is known, the messages become easy to decode.

---

# Question: What is the primary weakness of using secret encryption methods without keys?

**Answer:**
They are vulnerable to leaks—if the method becomes known, anyone can decrypt the messages, making the encryption ineffective.

---

# Question: What is Kerckhoffs’s Principle?

**Answer:**
Kerckhoffs’s Principle states that the security of a cryptographic system should depend only on the secrecy of the key, not on the secrecy of the encryption method itself.

---

# Question: How do modern encryption systems ensure security if the method is publicly known?

**Answer:**
They use secret cipher keys. Even if the encryption method is public, the data remains secure because only the correct key can successfully decrypt the message.

---

# Question: What is a cipher key in encryption?

**Answer:**
A cipher key is a secret value (such as a number or string) shared between the sender and receiver that determines how data is encrypted or decrypted within a known encryption method.

---

# Question: Why is it difficult to decrypt a transposition message without the key?

**Answer:**
Without the key, the sequence of rearranged letters is unknown, making it nearly impossible to reverse the process accurately without trying an enormous number of possibilities.

---

# Question: What is one strategy for maintaining encryption security against leaks?

**Answer:**
Regularly changing the cipher key helps prevent leaks from compromising the encryption, even if someone learns the method being used.

---

# Question: What is a brute-force attack in the context of encryption?

**Answer:**
A brute-force attack tries every possible permutation or key until the correct plaintext is found. It’s a trial-and-error method that becomes impractical when the number of combinations is very large.

---

# Question: How many possible permutations are there for the message "CATHY LIKES KEITH" using transposition?

**Answer:**
There are approximately **40 billion** possible permutations, making brute-force decryption very difficult without additional clues.

---

# Question: Why are brute-force attacks often inefficient?

**Answer:**
Because they test all possible combinations, many of which are nonsensical. This makes the process extremely slow unless additional information can help narrow down the possibilities.

---

# Question: How can an attacker improve their chances without using brute force?

**Answer:**
By using language patterns or context—like recognizing that most English words don’t start with “HT,” or guessing likely names or words in the message—an attacker can eliminate many permutations.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of varying the substitution pattern in encryption?

**Answer:**
Varying the substitution pattern strengthens encryption against frequency analysis by ensuring that the same plaintext letter can be replaced by different ciphertext letters throughout the message.

---

# Question: What is the name of the technique that uses varying substitution patterns during encryption?

**Answer:**
The technique is known as polyalphabetic substitution.

---

# Question: What is a tabula recta?

**Answer:**
A tabula recta is a grid of alphabets where each row and column is labeled with a letter of the alphabet, used to vary encryption in polyalphabetic substitution.

---

# Question: How are the rows and columns labeled in a tabula recta?

**Answer:**
Each row and column in a tabula recta is labeled with the letter of the alphabet that starts that row or column.

---

# Question: In a tabula recta, what does the intersection of row D and column H contain?

**Answer:**
The intersection of row D and column H contains the letter K.

---

# Question: What type of key is used in a tabula recta to vary encryption?

**Answer:**
A textual key, where letters are used to select columns, is used to vary encryption in a tabula recta.

---

# Question: In the tabula recta example, how is the first letter of the ciphertext derived from the plaintext letter S and key letter T?

**Answer:**
The first letter of the ciphertext is found at the intersection of row S and column T in the tabula recta, which is the letter L.

---

# Question: What happens when the plaintext is longer than the key in a tabula recta encryption?

**Answer:**
When the plaintext is longer than the key, the letters of the key are reused starting from the beginning.
