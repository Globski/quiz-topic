# Question: What does API stand for?

**Answer:** API stands for Application Programming Interface.

---

# Question: Why does the letter 'I' in API?

**Answer:** Interface.

---

# Question: What is meant by saying the interface abstracts away the complexity?

**Answer:** The interface hides the internal implementation details and only exposes usable options to the user.

---

# Question: What role does an interface play in technology as it evolves?

**Answer:** Interfaces abstract away complex details while incorporating new features, allowing users to control new functionalities without understanding their inner workings.

---

# Question: What is a GUI, and how is it related to physical interfaces?

**Answer:** A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is a visual interface that allows users to interact with software. Physical interfaces often inspire GUI design by mimicking familiar, recognizable components like buttons.

---

# Question: What is the role of the Play button in a streaming music app, and how does abstraction apply to it?

**Answer:** The Play button allows users to start music playback without needing to understand how it works internally. Abstraction hides the implementation details, making it user-friendly.

---

# Question: What kind of code does a developer write to make a button functional?

**Answer:** The developer writes an event handler, such as `onClick`, that triggers an action—like playing music—when the button is clicked.

---

# Question: What button behavior does the developer **not** have to code manually?

**Answer:** The developer does not need to code the physical interaction effects, such as visual feedback or clicking sounds, as these are abstracted by the interface.

---

# Question: In the context of app development, what is the button considered to be?

**Answer:** The button is an interface—specifically, part of the API provided by the application framework.

---

# Question: What does an application framework provide to developers?

**Answer:** It provides ready-made interfaces, like buttons, that abstract implementation details and allow developers to easily add functionality to their apps.

---

# Question: What does a media player API provided by an operating system do?

**Answer:** It abstracts the process of sending audio data to hardware, allowing developers to simply call methods like `play()` without handling low-level audio processing.

---

# Question: What kind of API interaction occurs when a song is streamed over the internet?

**Answer:** A web-based API call is made over the internet to fetch the song data.

---

# Question: What does the phrase "APIs all the way down" imply?

**Answer:** It suggests that APIs exist at every level of abstraction, from high-level user interactions to low-level binary data processing.

---

# Question: What common characteristic do all interfaces share?

**Answer:** They define how to interact or communicate with an object without revealing or requiring knowledge of its internal implementation.

---

# Question: What does a UI (User Interface) enable?

**Answer:** A UI allows **users** to interact with applications in a user-friendly way, abstracting the implementation details.

---

# Question: What does an API (Application Programming Interface) enable?

**Answer:** An API allows **developers** to interact with and extend an application's functionality without needing to know its underlying implementation.

---

# Question: How is an API like a contract?

**Answer:** An API defines expected usage and outputs, setting clear rules for how developers can interact with it and what results they can expect.

---

# Question: What advantages do APIs offer to software developers?

**Answer:** APIs simplify development by providing access to complex functionality and data, often enabling powerful features with just a few lines of code.

---

# Question: What is a common modern-day misunderstanding about the term "API"?

**Answer:** The term "API" is often incorrectly assumed to refer only to web-based APIs, though it actually applies to many types of programmatic interfaces.

---

# Question: Why is it important to understand all types of APIs, not just web-based ones?

**Answer:** Understanding all types of APIs helps developers see how abstraction works across software systems and why web-based APIs are so widespread and useful.

---

# Question: What kinds of APIs are typically provided by programming languages?

**Answer:** Programming languages offer APIs for common tasks like working with strings, handling files, and manipulating data.

---

# Question: How would you make a string all uppercase using a programming language?

**Answer:** By calling a string API method that transforms the string to uppercase, without needing to perform low-level character manipulation.

---

# Question: Why do programming languages offer APIs for string manipulation?

**Answer:** String manipulation is a common task, so APIs provide an abstracted, reusable way to perform these actions efficiently.

---

# Question: How can the same code run on both Windows and MacOS despite differences in file systems?

**Answer:** The programming language provides a single file system API, while the underlying OS supplies the appropriate implementation for its environment.

---

# Question: Why are language specifications considered interfaces?

**Answer:** Because they define consistent APIs that abstract implementation details, allowing different systems to implement the functionality in platform-specific ways.
