A *router* checks its routing table to decide the appropriate port for forwarding a packet based on the packet's destination address. This process is called *forwarding*.

---

# Question: What is forwarding in networking?

**Answer:**
*Forwarding* is the process by which a router sends a packet to the appropriate port based on the routing table, so that it continues toward its destination.

---

# Question: What does each router ignore when making a forwarding decision?

**Answer:**
Each *router* ignores the path the packet originally came from. Routing decisions are always forward-looking and never consider sending a packet back the way it came.

---

# Question: What creates the routing table entries in a router?

**Answer:**
Routing table entries are generated by the router’s *special processor*, which uses various *routing algorithms* to determine optimal paths for packet forwarding.

---

# Question: What happens at each router as a packet travels across the network?

**Answer:**
At each *router*, the device consults its own routing table to determine the next path for the packet, repeating this process until the packet reaches its final destination.

---

# Question: What is the main goal of a router when delivering a packet?

**Answer:**
A router's main goal is to deliver the packet to its destination **as fast as possible**. This objective guides how routing decisions are made.

---

# Question: Why might a router choose a longer path for a packet instead of the visually shortest one?

**Answer:**
Routers use complex **algorithms** and consider multiple **variables**, not just the number of hops. They may avoid the visually shortest path if it's **congested** or has higher **packet density**, in favor of a potentially longer path that offers **faster delivery**.

---

# Question: What role does **congestion control** play in routing decisions?

**Answer:**
**Congestion control** refers to the router’s decision-making process to **avoid busy paths**. If a route is experiencing high **traffic density**, a router may **intentionally avoid it**, even if it seems like the shortest route, to ensure faster and more reliable delivery.

---

# Question: How do routers determine which route to choose when forwarding packets?

**Answer:**
Routers determine routes based on **routing tables** generated by **routing algorithms** that consider various factors like **path length**, **traffic congestion**, and **network topology**, not just simple visual logic.

---

# Question: What misconception might people have when visually inspecting network routes?

**Answer:**
People often assume the visually **shortest path** is the best option. However, routers may select a different path based on more sophisticated **criteria and algorithms** that take into account real-time network conditions.

---

# Question: What happens when a router selects **path three** over **patter**, even though patter seems visually shorter?

**Answer:**
Selecting **path three** might increase the number of hops, but due to **lower congestion**, the packet may **arrive faster** at its destination. This is an example of routers preferring **efficiency** over apparent simplicity.

---

# Question: What is the outcome of congestion-aware routing on packet delivery?

**Answer:**
Congestion-aware routing may cause packets to traverse **more points**, but ensures they **avoid delays** caused by traffic, ultimately resulting in **faster delivery** to the destination.

---

# Question: What does the example of a packet traveling via multiple routers illustrate about internet communication?

# Question: Using the analogy of sending a letter, explain what VPN tunneling represents.

**Answer:**
In the analogy, sending a letter without an envelope means the postman (representing the public internet) can read the letter. Putting the letter inside an envelope represents VPN tunneling, where the original packet (letter) is encapsulated inside another packet (envelope), so the intermediate routers cannot read the original data.

---

# Question: What does encapsulation of packets mean in the context of VPN tunneling?

**Answer:**
Encapsulation means placing the original data packet (yellow packet) inside another packet (red packet), similar to putting a letter inside an envelope, which helps protect the contents during transit.

---

# Question: Does VPN tunneling alone guarantee complete security of the data packet? Explain why or why not.

**Answer:**
No, tunneling alone does not guarantee complete security because the outer packet can still be opened by someone with access to the network. Without encryption, the encapsulated packet’s contents could potentially be accessed.

---

# Question: How does encryption enhance security in VPN tunneling?

**Answer:**
Encryption transforms the original packet into unreadable data that only authorized users (e.g., company employees) can understand. Even if someone intercepts and opens the encapsulated packet, they cannot understand the encrypted information.

---

# Question: Describe the correct process for maximizing security of data packets using VPN.

**Answer:**
First, encrypt the original packet so its contents are unreadable. Then, encapsulate this encrypted packet inside another packet (tunneling). This combined approach protects the packet both by hiding it inside another packet and by encrypting its contents.

---

# Question: What happens to the encapsulated and encrypted packet once it reaches the destination router?

**Answer:**
The destination router removes the outer packet (decapsulation), decrypts the encrypted original packet to retrieve the readable data, then examines the packet’s destination address and forwards it accordingly.

# Question: What is the main benefit of using VPN technology to connect two LANs?

**Answer:**
VPN technology allows secure communication between two LANs over the public internet, enabling safe transfer of company-related information despite the internet being a public network.

---

# Question: Is VPN technology 100% secure? Why or why not?

**Answer:**
No, VPN technology is not 100% secure because every system can have security vulnerabilities. However, VPNs currently provide a level of security that is generally satisfactory for both budget and protection.

---

# Question: If everyday internet operations (like sending emails or shopping online) occur over a public network, are these operations insecure?

**Answer:**
Not necessarily. While the internet is a public network, security depends on whether encryption or secure protocols (like HTTPS) are used. Some operations are secure due to encryption, while others may not be.

# Question: How is credit card information protected when sent over the internet during online purchases?

**Answer:**
Credit card information is protected using encryption between the user’s computer and the destination server (e.g., amazon.com). This encryption ensures that nobody except the destination server can read the sensitive information.

---

# Question: What was the major security problem before encryption was commonly used for internet communications?

**Answer:**
Before encryption was used, sensitive information like credit card details was sent in plain text, making it easy for hackers to intercept and read the data.

---

# Question: What is the largest wide area network (WAN) in the world?

**Answer:**
The largest wide area network in the world is the internet itself.

---

# Question: How is a company’s VPN-based WAN different from the internet?

**Answer:**
A company’s VPN WAN is private and dedicated to the company, whereas the internet is a public network owned and used by everyone worldwide.

---

# Question: If two company offices are 100 meters apart, can their switches be directly connected to create a LAN?

**Answer:**
Yes, if the distance is short like 100 meters, switches can be directly connected to create a LAN.

---

# Question: What is a campus area network (CAN)?

**Answer:**
A campus area network (CAN) is a network created by connecting switches over a relatively short distance, such as between buildings on a university campus.

---

# Question: When offices are farther apart and cannot connect switches directly, what network solution can be used?

**Answer:**
When the distance is too great to connect switches directly, the offices can be connected using a VPN to create a WAN.

---

# Question: Between a LAN created by directly connecting switches and a VPN-based WAN, which is more secure and why?

**Answer:**
A LAN is more secure because the data packets never leave the local physical cable network and do not traverse the public internet, reducing exposure to external threats. Even though VPN provides protection, the packets still travel over the public internet.

---

# Question: Why does a VPN WAN still pose some security concerns despite encryption and tunneling?

**Answer:**
Because packets in a VPN WAN still travel over the public internet, there is always a potential risk of interception or vulnerability, whereas in a LAN, data stays within a controlled physical network.

---

# Question: Why might an average company prefer a public WAN over a private WAN?

**Answer:**
Because a public WAN provides sufficient security at a more affordable cost, making it a practical choice for many companies.

---

# Question: What devices are used to create a LAN, and which devices are used to create a WAN?

**Answer:**
Switches are used to create a LAN, while routers are used to create a WAN.

---

# Question: Can a WAN be created using switches? Why or why not?

**Answer:**
No, a WAN cannot be created using switches because a WAN fundamentally involves connecting different LANs across various locations, which requires routers.

---

# Question: What is the primary function of a router?

**Answer:**
The primary function of a router is to connect different networks, regardless of whether they are in the same office or different parts of the world.

---

# Question: In an office setting, how can routers help connect different networks?

**Answer:**
Routers connect different networks within the same office, such as connecting the marketing unit’s LAN with the software unit’s LAN, enabling communication between them.

---

# Question: How are the cables on a router typically connected, and what does each cable represent?

**Answer:**
Each cable is connected to a different network; for example, one cable might connect to LAN one, another to LAN two, and another to the internet. Each port on the router represents a different network connection.

---

# Question: Why might there be multiple different networks within the same office?

**Answer:**
Multiple networks may be needed within the same office to separate different departments or units, such as marketing and software, for security, management, or organizational purposes.
