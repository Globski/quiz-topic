```php
$var1 = 100;
$var2 = "100";
$var3 = $var1 + $var2;
var_dump($var3);
```

---

# Question: How does PHP handle a string with digits followed by non-numeric characters in an arithmetic expression?

**Answer:** PHP parses the leading digits, ignores the non-numeric trailing characters, performs the calculation, and issues a warning.

---

# Question: What warning is issued when using a partially numeric string in arithmetic?

**Answer:** `PHP Warning: A non-numeric value encountered`

---

# Question: What is the output of this code, and what else happens?

```php

---

# Question: What is the output of this code?

```php
$var1 = 100;
$var2 = (string)$var1;
var_dump($var2);
```

**Answer:** `string(3) "100"`

---

---

# Question: What is the output of casting an integer to an array?

```php
$var1 = 100;
$var2 = (array)$var1;
var_dump($var2);
```

**Answer:** `array(1) { [0] => int(100) }`

---

# Question: What happens when you cast an integer to an object in PHP?

**Answer:** PHP creates an object of class `stdClass` with a property `scalar` holding the integer value.

---

# Question: What is the output of this object cast?

```php
$var1 = 100;
$var2 = (object)$var1;
var_dump($var2);
```

**Answer:** `object(stdClass)#1 (1) { ["scalar"]=> int(100) }`

**Answer:** Both `$var2` and `$var3` will output `string(5) "100.5"`

---

# Question: What is PHP Type Juggling vulnerability?

**Answer:** It’s a security issue where PHP’s automatic type conversion during comparisons allows different values to be considered equal, potentially enabling unauthorized access.

---

# Question: Why does `"123abc" == 123` return true in PHP?

**Answer:** Because PHP converts the string to the number `123`, ignoring the non-numeric part, so both sides are considered equal numerically.

---

# Question: Why should you avoid `==` in security-related comparisons in PHP?

**Answer:** Because `==` allows type juggling, which can equate different types and values, leading to security flaws.

---

# Question: How do you prevent PHP type juggling issues in comparisons?

**Answer:** Use strict comparison `===`, which checks both the value and the type.

---

# Question: What is the result of `"123abc" === 123`?

**Answer:** `false`, because one is a string and the other is an integer.
