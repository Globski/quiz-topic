# Question: What is Content Security Policy (CSP) and how does it help mitigate XSS?

**Answer:**
CSP restricts the sources from which content like scripts, images, and styles can be loaded, minimizing the risk of XSS by allowing only trusted content.

---

# Question: How would you implement a CSP to limit scripts to the website itself?

**Answer:**
By setting a header like `Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';` which allows scripts only from the site’s own domain.

# Question: What is input encoding and escaping, and why is it important?

**Answer:**
It transforms special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`) into safe representations to prevent them from being executed as code, protecting against HTML injection and XSS.

---

# Question: Give an example of a function used for encoding inputs in PHP.

**Answer:**
The function `htmlspecialchars()` encodes special characters to their HTML entities.

---

# Question: Why should security testing and scanning tools be used regularly?

**Answer:**
To automatically detect input validation vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and XSS before attackers exploit them.

---

# Question: Name two dynamic and two static analysis tools for security testing.

**Answer:**
Dynamic: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
Static: SonarQube, Checkmarx

---

# Question: What is the role of a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in input validation security?

**Answer:**
A WAF filters and blocks malicious traffic before it reaches the application, preventing common injection attacks.

---

# Question: Can you give an example of a WAF that blocks injection attacks?

**Answer:**
Cloudflare WAF, which detects and blocks common injection patterns and known attack vectors.

---

# Question: Why are regular code reviews important in preventing input validation attacks?

**Answer:**
They help identify flaws early in development, ensuring secure coding practices are followed to validate and sanitize inputs properly.

---

# Question: What guidelines can developers follow to improve input validation?

**Answer:**
OWASP Secure Coding Practices provide recommendations to prioritize input validation and secure development.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of code reviews in preventing input validation attacks?

**Answer:**
Code reviews focus on areas where user input is processed to ensure proper validation methods are implemented, helping to identify and fix vulnerabilities early.

---

# Question: Name two HTTP security headers that help block input validation attacks.

**Answer:**
X-XSS-Protection and X-Content-Type-Options.

---

# Question: What does the HTTP header `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` do?

**Answer:**
It prevents browsers from interpreting files as different MIME types, reducing the risk of certain types of attacks like MIME sniffing.

---

# Question: Why is continuous monitoring and logging important in security?

**Answer:**
It helps detect and respond to suspicious activities or attacks in real time by analyzing user interactions and input patterns.

---

# Question: Give an example of what to monitor in logs to detect input validation attacks.

**Answer:**
Repeated injection patterns or unusual file path requests can indicate ongoing attack attempts.
