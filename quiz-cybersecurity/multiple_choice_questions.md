---

# Question: What is Cross-site Scripting (XSS)?

**Answer:**
Cross-site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts execute in the user’s browser, potentially compromising sensitive information, user sessions, or control over user accounts.

---

# Question: What are the three main types of XSS?

**Answer:**
The three main types of XSS are Stored (Persistent) XSS, Reflected (Non-Persistent) XSS, and DOM-Based XSS.

---

# Question: What is Stored XSS and how does it work?

**Answer:**
Stored XSS occurs when malicious code is permanently saved on the server, such as in databases or files (e.g., comments or profiles). The injected script executes automatically whenever a user accesses the affected page.

---

# Question: What is an example of Stored XSS?

**Answer:**
An example is an attacker placing malicious JavaScript in a blog comment. Every user reading the comment triggers the script execution in their browser.

---

# Question: How does Reflected XSS differ from Stored XSS?

**Answer:**
Reflected XSS involves malicious scripts included in URLs or form inputs, which are immediately reflected back by the server in the response without being stored. The script executes only when the user clicks a specially crafted link or submits data.

---

# Question: What is DOM-Based XSS?

**Answer:**
DOM-Based XSS is a client-side vulnerability where malicious scripts execute directly in the browser through the Document Object Model (DOM), without involving server-side reflection or storage.

---

# Question: How does Reflected XSS work, and what is its typical impact?

**Answer:**
Reflected XSS occurs when malicious code is included in a URL or form input and reflected immediately by the server in its response without being stored. The attacker tricks a user into clicking a malicious link, causing the injected script to execute in the user’s browser.

---

# Question: What is an example scenario of Reflected XSS?

**Answer:**
An attacker sends a phishing email containing a malicious URL. When the user clicks the link, the website reflects the script back in the response, executing it on the user’s browser.

---

# Question: What distinguishes DOM-Based XSS from other types of XSS?

**Answer:**
DOM-Based XSS happens entirely on the client side by manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) in the browser, without sending malicious input to the server or storing it there.

---

# Question: Why is DOM-Based XSS harder to detect?

**Answer:**
Because it executes purely in the browser by altering the DOM, DOM-Based XSS does not appear in server logs or interact with server-side scripts, making detection more difficult.

---

# Question: Can you give an example of a DOM-Based XSS attack?

**Answer:**
If a webpage’s JavaScript takes a URL parameter and directly inserts it into the page without sanitization, an attacker can craft a URL to inject a script that changes the page content or behavior.

---

# Question: What are some common prevention strategies against all types of XSS?

**Answer:**
Preventative measures include sanitizing user inputs, encoding outputs properly, and implementing security headers like Content Security Policy (CSP) to reduce risk.
