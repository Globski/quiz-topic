# Question: List all C++ iostream objects and describe their usage.

## C++ `<iostream>` Objects

The `<iostream>` library provides objects used for standard input and output operations.

| Object  | Description                                                         |

| `cin`   | Standard input stream (usually reads from keyboard)                 |
| `cout`  | Standard output stream (usually writes to the console)              |
| `cerr`  | Standard error output stream (unbuffered; used for error messages)  |
| `clog`  | Standard log output stream (buffered; used for logging information) |
| `wcin`  | Wide-character version of `cin`; reads `wchar_t` input              |
| `wcout` | Wide-character version of `cout`; writes `wchar_t` output           |
| `wcerr` | Wide-character version of `cerr`; writes `wchar_t` error output     |
| `wclog` | Wide-character version of `clog`; writes `wchar_t` log output       |
