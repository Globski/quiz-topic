# Another comment
```

**Answer:** `1` line — only `"Hello, Ruby!"` will be output.

---

# Question: How do you write a multi-line comment in Ruby?

**Answer:** Use `=begin` to start and `=end` to close the comment block.

---

# Question: In Ruby, where must `=begin` and `=end` appear?

**Answer:** They must appear at the **beginning of the line**, without indentation.

---

# Question: What happens if `=begin` is indented in a Ruby file?

**Answer:** Ruby will not recognize it as the start of a multi-line comment, and it may raise an error or behave unexpectedly.
