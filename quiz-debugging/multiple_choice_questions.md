---

# Question: What is collaborative debugging?

**Answer:** Collaborative debugging involves multiple developers working together to identify and fix issues, especially when multiple modules are involved.

---

# Question: How do logging and tracing assist in debugging?

**Answer:** Logging and tracing capture the sequence of events before an error, allowing developers to analyze system behavior during execution.

---

# Question: What is automated debugging?

**Answer:** Automated debugging uses tools, including static and dynamic analysis, machine learning, and AI, to detect errors and suggest fixes.

---

# Question: Give examples of syntax-related errors found during debugging.

---

# Question: What is a logical error in debugging?

**Answer:** A logical error occurs when the program runs but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.

---

# Question: What are runtime errors?

**Answer:** Runtime errors occur while the program is running, often due to invalid operations such as division by zero or accessing unavailable resources.

---
