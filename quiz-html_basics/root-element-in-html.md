# Question: What is the root element in an HTML document and what is its significance?

**Answer:**  
The root element of an HTML page is the `<html>` element. It is the top-level element and must be the ancestor of all other elements in the document.

Example structure:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>...</head>
  <body>...</body>
</html>
```

- The <html> tag encloses the entire content of the HTML document.
