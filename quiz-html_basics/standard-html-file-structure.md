# Question: What is the basic structure of a standard HTML file?

**Answer:**  
A standard HTML file includes the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Heading Line</h1>
<p>Paragraph Lines</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` acts as a declaration that this document is an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of the HTML page.
- The `<head>` element contains metadata for the HTML page.
- The `<title>` tag produces a title for the webpage we are currently rendering(our HTML page).
- The `<body>` defines the body of the document, and is basically a container for all the contents which is visible in the HTML page like hyperlinks, headings, titles, paragraphs, etc.
- The `<h1>` tag is basically a heading. The ‘1’ represents the size of the heading, 1 being the largest and 6 being the smallest.
- The `<p>` tag basically defines a paragraph.
