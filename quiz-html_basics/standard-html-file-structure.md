# Question: What is the basic structure of a standard HTML file?

**Answer:**  
A standard HTML file includes the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title Page</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Heading Line</h1>
<p>Paragraph Lines</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type.
- The `<html>` element is the root of the HTML document.
- The `<head>` section contains metadata, like the page title.
- The `<body>` section contains the visible content such as headings and paragraphs.
