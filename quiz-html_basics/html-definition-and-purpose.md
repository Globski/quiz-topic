# Question: What does HTML stand for and what is its purpose?

**Answer:**  
**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a language interpreted by web browsers to define the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses “tags” to mark up text, images, and other elements, instructing the browser what to display and how to display it. It is the standardized system used to create and design web pages.

 An HTML document is a plaintext document formatted using elements. These elements are surrounded by opening and closing tags, which use angle brackets (`<>`).  
- Tags like `<image>`, `<p>`, etc., can be empty or void and do not contain any text.  
- Attributes can be added to HTML tags to provide additional information that affects how the browser interprets the element.
