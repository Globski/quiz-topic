# Question: What does HTML stand for and what is its purpose?

**Answer:**  
**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. It is a language interpreted by web browsers to define the structure and content of web pages. HTML uses “tags” to mark up text, images, and other elements, instructing the browser what to display and how to display it. It is the standardized system used to create and design web pages.

 An HTML document is a plaintext document formatted using elements. These elements are surrounded by opening and closing tags, which use angle brackets (`<>`).  
- Tags like `<image>`, `<p>`, etc., can be empty or void and do not contain any text.  
- Attributes can be added to HTML tags to provide additional information that affects how the browser interprets the element.

---

# Question: What is the root element in an HTML document and what is its significance?

**Answer:**  
The root element of an HTML page is the `<html>` element. It is the top-level element and must be the ancestor of all other elements in the document.

Example structure:  
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>...</head>
  <body>...</body>
</html>
```

- The <html> tag encloses the entire content of the HTML document.

---

# Question: How do you indicate the character set being used by an HTML document?

**Answer:**

The character set of an HTML document is specified using the `<meta>` tag inside the `<head>` section. This tells the browser how to interpret the characters in the document, ensuring correct display of text.

The most common character set used today is **UTF-8**, which supports virtually all characters from all languages.

**Example:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Example Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This document uses UTF-8 character encoding.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

> By including `<meta charset="UTF-8">`, you ensure that the browser correctly interprets the document's character encoding.

# Question: Why do we use HTML?

**Answer:**  
HTML ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that web browsers can display them correctly.

The basic skeleton of an HTML document looks like this:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title> Title </title>
</head>
<body>
..........................
....Body contents here....
..........................
</body>
