# Question: What is the advantage of collapsing white space in HTML?

**Answer:**  
In HTML, a sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) is treated as a single space. This collapsing of white space helps developers indent and format their HTML code for readability without affecting how the content is displayed in the browser.
