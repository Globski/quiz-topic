# Question: Why is HTML important in web development, and why is it not sufficient alone?

**Answer:**  
HTML is important because it defines the structure of web content and is essential for web designers and developers. However, HTML alone is not sufficient because it only structures the data. To make web pages visually appealing and functional, CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) are also needed.
