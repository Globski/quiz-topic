# Question: How can you optimize website asset loading to improve load time?

**Answer:**  
To optimize website load time by improving asset loading, the following methods are used:

- **CDN Hosting:** Use geographically distributed servers to reduce latency.  
- **File Compression:** Compress files to reduce their size and data transfer.  
- **File Concatenation:** Combine multiple files to reduce the number of HTTP requests.  
- **Minify Scripts:** Remove unnecessary characters from JavaScript and CSS files to reduce file size.  
- **Parallel Downloads:** Host assets on multiple subdomains to bypass browser download limits per domain.  
- **Lazy Loading:** Load non-critical assets only when needed instead of all at once.
