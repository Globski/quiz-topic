# Question: Why do we use HTML?

**Answer:**  
HTML ensures the proper formatting of text and images so that web browsers can display them correctly. Without HTML, browsers wouldnâ€™t know how to display text as elements or load images and other content. HTML provides the basic structure (the "bones") of a web page, while CSS adds styling (the "skin") to change its appearance.

The basic skeleton of an HTML document looks like this:

```html
<html>
<head>
<title> Title </title>
</head>
<body>
..........................
....Body contents here....
..........................
</body>
</html>
