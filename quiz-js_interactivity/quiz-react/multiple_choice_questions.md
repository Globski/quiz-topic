A **library** is a collection of functionalities that can be reused in your own code. It helps developers **write less and better code**, solving common problems more quickly and allowing them to focus on their application's core logic.

---

# Question: How does using a library like React improve development?

**Answer:**  
React allows developers to write **shorter, more efficient code**, avoid reinventing the wheel, and focus on core business logic. This leads to **faster development** and often **higher-quality code**.

---

# Question: What is React Native?

**Answer:**  
React Native is a **library built on React** that allows developers to create **native mobile applications** using the same concepts and syntax as React for the web.

---

# Question: Why can creating user interfaces with plain JavaScript be difficult?

**Answer:**  
Building complex, interactive user interfaces with just plain JavaScript can become **overwhelming and error-prone**, as it involves managing a lot of state and DOM manipulation manually.

---

# Question: Do the concepts learned in React for web also apply to React Native?

**Answer:**  
Yes, the **core concepts of React** are applicable across platforms, including both **web and mobile development** using React Native.

---

# Question: Why should developers use a library like React instead of vanilla JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Because React provides **optimized, reusable solutions** for building complex UIs, it helps avoid the pitfalls of manual DOM manipulation and improves **efficiency, readability, and scalability**.

---

# Question: What is "vanilla JavaScript"?

**Answer:**  
"Vanilla JavaScript" refers to using **plain JavaScript** without any external libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue. It's just the core JavaScript language and browser APIs.

---

# Question: What is a key advantage of using vanilla JavaScript in web development?

**Answer:**  
Vanilla JavaScript usually results in **smaller file sizes**, as it doesn’t include the additional code from frameworks or libraries. This means **faster downloads** for users and potentially better performance.

---

# Question: What is the main downside of using vanilla JavaScript for complex user interfaces?

**Answer:**  
The developer must implement **all functionalities from scratch**, which can be **error-prone**, **time-consuming**, and difficult to manage for **larger or more interactive applications**.

---

# Question: How does React improve the development experience compared to vanilla JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
React provides a more manageable way to build interfaces by **moving from an imperative to a declarative approach**, simplifying the creation and maintenance of complex UIs.

---

# Question: What does "imperative vs declarative" mean in the context of JavaScript and React?

**Answer:**  
In an **imperative approach**, you manually describe each step the program must take (like vanilla JavaScript).  
In a **declarative approach** (like in React), you describe **what** the UI should look like in a given state, and React handles **how** to update the DOM.

---

# Question: Provide a simple vanilla JavaScript example of updating a paragraph’s text when a button is clicked.

**Answer:**  
```javascript
const buttonElement = document.querySelector('button');
const paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p');

function updateTextHandler() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Text was changed!';
}

buttonElement.addEventListener('click', updateTextHandler);
```

---

# Question: What are the two DOM elements selected in the vanilla JavaScript example?

**Answer:**  
- A `<button>` element  
- A `<p>` (paragraph) element

---

# Question: What happens when the button is clicked in the vanilla JavaScript example?

**Answer:**  
The paragraph text is changed to `'Text was changed!'` by modifying the `textContent` property of the `<p>` element.
