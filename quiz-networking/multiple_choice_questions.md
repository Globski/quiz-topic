# Question: What is the OSI model and who developed it?

**Answer:**
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a reference model developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that provides a common basis for coordinating standards development for systems interconnection.

# Question: How many layers does the OSI model have, and what are they called?

**Answer:**
The OSI model has seven layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application.

# Question: What range of communication does the OSI model describe?

**Answer:**
It describes communications from the physical transmission of bits across a medium to the highest-level data representation in a distributed application.

# Question: How do the layers in the OSI model interact?

**Answer:**
Each layer has defined functions, serving the layer above it and being served by the layer below, allowing communication through the exchange of protocol data units (PDUs) between peer layers.

# Question: What is the Internet protocol suite and how does it relate to the OSI model?

**Answer:**
The Internet protocol suite, developed contemporaneously with the OSI model and primarily funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, focuses mainly on software layers of communication and has a less rigorous structure compared to the OSI model. It was the foundation for the development of the Internet.

# Question: Why is the OSI model considered important in networking?

**Answer:**
The OSI model provides a widely accepted, user-friendly framework that standardizes and clarifies networking concepts, enabling transparent peer-to-peer communication and serving as the standard teaching model in IT.

# Question: What does peer-to-peer networking mean in the context of the OSI model?

**Answer:**
Peer-to-peer networking refers to the transparent communication between equivalent layers (peers) on two different systems through the exchange of protocol data units (PDUs).
