---

# Question: How do you declare a string variable `color` in C that can hold up to 20 characters?

**Answer:** `char color[20];`

---

# Question: Why do we specify a size (e.g., 20) for character arrays in C?

**Answer:** To allocate enough memory for the input string including the null terminator.

---

# Question: What format specifier is used in `scanf` to read a string?

**Answer:** `%s`

---

# Question: Do you need to use the ampersand (`&`) when reading a string with `scanf`?

**Answer:** No, because the array name already acts as a pointer.

---

# Question: What is the correct syntax to read input into the `color` variable using `scanf`?

**Answer:** `scanf("%s", color);`

---

# Question: How do you print a string stored in the variable `color` using `printf`?

**Answer:** `printf("%s", color);`

---

# Question: In the  Libs program, how are the user-provided values inserted into the story?

**Answer:** By using `printf` with `%s` format specifiers and passing the string variables as arguments.

---

# Question: What does the final printed story look like in the Libs example?

**Answer:**

```
Roses are [color]  
[Plural noun] are blue  
I love [celebrity]
```

---

# Question: Why are newline characters (`\n`) used in the final `printf` statements of the Libs program?

**Answer:** To format the output with line breaks for better readability.

---

# Question: What is a key difference in using `scanf` for strings versus numbers?

**Answer:** Strings do not require the ampersand (`&`), whereas numbers do.

---

# Question: Why is the calculator program updated to use `double` instead of `int`?

**Answer:** To correctly handle decimal (floating-point) input and addition.

---

# Question: What happens when `scanf` is used to take input with whitespace, like a full name?

**Answer:** `scanf` stops reading input at the first whitespace, so it will not capture anything beyond the first word.

---

# Question: How can we modify a C program to read a full name using `scanf`?

**Answer:** By using two separate variables (e.g., `celebrityF` and `celebrityL`) and two `%s` format specifiers in `scanf` to capture first and last names separately.

---

# Question: What issue occurs if a user enters only one name when using two `%s` format specifiers in `scanf`?

**Answer:** The program will pause and wait for the second input, potentially causing confusion if only one name was intended.

---

# Question: What must you consider when using `scanf` for multiple words of input?

**Answer:** You must be explicit about the number of words the user is expected to input, as `scanf` handles space-separated inputs as separate values.

---

# Question: Why must programmers be specific about user input in C?

**Answer:** Because C does not automatically handle ambiguous input formats, and improper handling can cause runtime issues or incorrect data capture.

---

# Question: What is an array in C?

**Answer:** An array is a container that stores multiple values of the same data type in a contiguous memory block.

---

# Question: Why are arrays useful in C programming?

**Answer:** Arrays allow storage and management of large, related data sets without needing to create multiple individual variables.

---

# Question: How do you declare an array of integers in C?

**Answer:** `int luckyNumbers[] = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};`

---

# Question: What symbol indicates to C that a variable is an array?

**Answer:** Square brackets `[]` following the variable name.

---

# Question: How are array elements separated in an initializer list?

**Answer:** By commas.

---

# Question: What is each value inside an array called?

**Answer:** An element.

---

# Question: What data types can be used to create arrays?

**Answer:** Any primitive type, such as `int`, `char`, or `double`.

---

# Question: How do you access the first element of an array?

**Answer:** Using index 0, e.g., `luckyNumbers[0]`.

---

# Question: What value does `luckyNumbers[2]` refer to in the array `{4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42}`?

**Answer:** `15`

---

# Question: What is the index of the last element in a 6-element array?

**Answer:** `5`, because array indexing starts at `0`.

---

# Question: Why does array indexing in C start at 0?

**Answer:** It reflects how memory addresses are calculated, where the base address represents index 0.

---

# Question: How can you print a specific value from an array in C?

**Answer:** Using `printf("%d", arrayName[index]);`

---

# Question: How do you modify an element in a C array?

**Answer:** Assign a new value to the indexed element, e.g., `luckyNumbers[1] = 200;`

---

# Question: After executing `luckyNumbers[1] = 200;`, what does `luckyNumbers[1]` contain?

**Answer:** `200`

---

# Question: Can arrays in C store different data types in the same array?

**Answer:** No, all elements in an array must be of the same data type.

---

# Question: What is the syntax to access an array element?

**Answer:** `arrayName[index]`, where `index` is an integer.

---

# Question: How many elements does this array store? `int luckyNumbers[] = {4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42};`

**Answer:** 6 elements.

---

# Question: What happens if you try to access an array index that is out of bounds?

**Answer:** Undefined behavior; it may crash the program or return unpredictable results.
