# Question: Why is C considered an important programming language to learn?

**Answer:** Because it is one of the oldest programming languages and many modern languages are based on it, including C++.

---

# Question: What are the two main things needed to start programming in C?

**Answer:** A text editor (or IDE) and a C compiler.

---

# Question: What is a text editor used for in C programming?

**Answer:** To write and save the source code of C programs.

---

# Question: What is an IDE, and why is it useful for C programming?

**Answer:** An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a specialized text editor that simplifies writing, managing, and debugging C programs.

---

# Question: What does IDE stand for?

**Answer:** Integrated Development Environment.

---

# Question: What is the role of the C compiler in the programming process?

**Answer:** To compile, or translate, C source code into a language that the computer can understand and execute.

---

# Question: Why can't the computer execute C source code directly?

**Answer:** Because the source code must first be compiled into machine code, which is the only language the computer can understand.

---

# Question: What command can macOS users run in Terminal to check if a C compiler is already installed?

**Answer:** `cc -v`

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the `cc -v` command on macOS?

**Answer:** It checks whether a C compiler is already installed by printing the compiler version and details if available.

---

# Question: What command should macOS users run if the C compiler is not installed?

**Answer:** `xcode-select --install`

---

# Question: What does the `xcode-select --install` command do?

**Answer:** It installs Xcode command-line tools, which include the C compiler.

---

# Question: What is the purpose of the `#include` lines at the top of a C file?

**Answer:** They include necessary libraries for the program to function. (Detailed explanation comes later in the course.)

---

# Question: What is the significance of the `main` function in a C program?

**Answer:** It is the entry point where execution begins when the program runs.

---

# Question: What is a method (function) in C?

**Answer:** A container where instructions (code) can be written and executed by the computer.

---

# Question: What is the role of the `printf` function in `main.c` code?

**Answer:** It prints text (e.g., "Hello, World") to the screen.

---

# Question: What are the two steps required to execute a C program?

**Answer:** First, **build (compile)** the program; then **run** the built executable.

---

# Question: What does compiling a C program do?

**Answer:** It translates human-readable C code into machine-readable code the computer can execute.

---

# Question: What will happen if a C program has no output instruction like `printf`?

**Answer:** The console window may not appear because there's nothing to display.
