Yes, by adding `#` after the code on the same line. Python will ignore everything after the `#`.

---

# Question: How can comments be used to prevent code from running?

**Answer:**
By adding a `#` before the code line, making it a comment so Python skips executing it.

---

# Question: Does Python have a specific syntax for multiline comments?

**Answer:**
No, Python does not have a dedicated multiline comment syntax. You can use multiple single-line comments (`#` on each line) or use a multiline string (triple quotes) that is not assigned to a variable as a workaround.

---

# Question: How does using triple quotes (`""" ... """`) create a multiline comment?

**Answer:**
Triple-quoted strings that are not assigned to any variable are ignored by Python at runtime, effectively acting as multiline comments.

---

# Question: How are variables created in Python?

**Answer:**
Variables are created when you assign a value to a name. Python does not require declaring the variable type beforehand.

---

# Question: Can variables change their data type after being created? Provide an example.

```python
print(x, y, z)
```

---

# Question: How can you concatenate multiple string variables in a print statement?

**Answer:**
Using the `+` operator to join strings. Example:

```python
print(x + y + z)
```

Make sure to include spaces inside the strings if you want spaces in the output.

---

# Question: What happens when you try to add a string and a number using the `+` operator in `print()`?

**Answer:**
Python raises a TypeError because you cannot directly add (concatenate) a string and an integer.

---

# Question: What is the preferred way to print variables of different data types together?

**Answer:**
Separate them with commas in the `print()` function, which supports different data types. Example:

```python
print(x, y)
```

---

# Question: What is a global variable in Python?

**Answer:**
A global variable is a variable created outside of any function, accessible both inside and outside of functions.

---

# Question: What happens if you create a variable with the same name inside a function?

**Answer:**
The variable inside the function is local to that function and does not affect the global variable with the same name.

---

# Question: How can you create or modify a global variable inside a function?

**Answer:**
By using the `global` keyword before the variable name inside the function.

---

# Question: Provide an example of using the `global` keyword to create a global variable inside a function.

`+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), `/` (division), `//` (floor division), `%` (modulus), and `**` (exponentiation).

---

# Question: What is the difference between `/` and `//` operators in Python?

**Answer:**
`/` performs classic division and returns a floating-point number; `//` performs floor division and returns an integer result by discarding the fractional part.

---

# Question: What happens if you try to use a variable before assigning a value in Python?

**Answer:**
Python raises a `NameError` indicating the variable is not defined.

---

# Question: How does Python handle operations involving integers and floating-point numbers?

**Answer:**
If operands have mixed types (int and float), Python converts the integer to float before the operation.

---

# Question: How does Python represent text data and what are the ways to define strings?

**Answer:**
Text data is represented by the `str` type (strings). Strings can be enclosed in single quotes `'...'` or double quotes `"..."` with the same effect.

---

# Question: How do you include a quote character inside a string?

**Answer:**
Either escape the quote using a backslash `\'` or use the other type of quote to enclose the string.

---

# Question: What does the print() function do differently compared to just typing a string in the Python shell?

**Answer:**
`print()` outputs the string without quotes and interprets special characters like `\n` as newlines, providing more readable output.

---

# Question: How do you create a raw string, and what is its purpose?

**Answer:**
By prefixing the string literal with `r` (e.g., `r'C:\path'`). Raw strings prevent backslash escapes from being processed.

---

# Question: What are string slicing and indexing? How are negative indices used?

**Answer:**
Indexing accesses a single character by position (starting at 0). Negative indices count from the end (-1 is last character). Slicing extracts substrings by specifying start and end indices.

---

# Question: Are Python strings mutable? What happens if you try to assign to an indexed position?

**Answer:**
Strings are immutable; attempting to assign to an indexed position results in a `TypeError`.

---

# Question: How can you concatenate and repeat strings in Python?

**Answer:**
Use the `+` operator to concatenate and the `*` operator to repeat strings.

---

# Question: What is a list in Python, and how is it different from a string?

**Answer:**
A list is a mutable sequence of items (possibly of different types) enclosed in square brackets `[ ]`. Unlike strings, lists can be modified after creation.

---

# Question: How do you add new elements to a list?

**Answer:**
Using the `append()` method, e.g., `list.append(element)` adds an item at the end.

---

# Question: What happens when you assign one list variable to another?

**Answer:**
Both variables refer to the same list object; changes via one variable affect the other.

---

# Question: How do you create a shallow copy of a list?

**Answer:**
By slicing the entire list: `copy = original[:]`.

---

# Question: How does Python treat slices that are out of the valid index range?

**Answer:**
Out-of-range slice indices are handled gracefully and do not raise errors; the slice simply includes all valid elements within the range.

---

# Question: What is the syntax for a while loop in Python, and what must follow a compound statement entered interactively?

**Answer:**
A while loop starts with `while <condition>:` followed by an indented block. When entered interactively, a blank line must follow the block to indicate its end.

---

# Question: What does the statement `a, b = b, a + b` do in Python?

**Answer:**
It simultaneously assigns `a` to `b`’s value and `b` to `a + b` — multiple assignment with right-hand side expressions evaluated before assignment.

---

# Question: How does Python treat non-zero and zero values in conditions?

**Answer:**
Non-zero values are treated as `True`, zero as `False`. Similarly, non-empty sequences are `True` and empty sequences are `False`.

---

# Question: What is the use of the keyword argument `end` in the print() function?

**Answer:**
It specifies what to print after the output; for example, `end=','` prevents a newline and appends a comma instead.

---

**Answer:** The connection is closed using `connection.close()`.

---

# Question: What confirms that the connection and disconnection process worked correctly?

**Answer:** The script outputs that it connected to the database and then closed the connection.

---

# Question: What happens if incorrect credentials are used (e.g., wrong username)?

**Answer:** An error message is shown, demonstrating that the error-handling block works.

---

# Question: What is an f-string in Python?

**Answer:**
An f-string in Python is a string literal prefixed with `f` or `F` that allows embedding expressions within curly braces `{}`. These expressions are evaluated at runtime, making string interpolation concise and efficient.

---

# Question: How do you include dynamic content in an f-string?

**Answer:**
To include dynamic content in an f-string, you place variables or expressions inside curly braces `{}` within the string literal prefixed with `f`. Python evaluates and replaces the expressions with their values at runtime.

---

# Question: What causes a typical f-string error in Python?

**Answer:**
F-string errors often occur due to syntax issues like unmatched braces `{}` or invalid expressions inside the curly braces.

---

# Question: What are some improvements made to f-strings in Python 3.12?

**Answer:**
Python 3.12 improved f-strings by allowing nested expressions and the use of backslashes within the curly braces, removing previous parser limitations.

---

# Question: What were the two main ways to interpolate strings before Python 3.6?

**Answer:**
Before Python 3.6, Python primarily used the modulo operator `%` and the `str.format()` method for string interpolation.

---

# Question: How does the modulo operator `%` work for string interpolation?

**Answer:**
The `%` operator takes a string with conversion specifiers (like `%s`) and an object or tuple of objects. It replaces the specifiers with string representations of the objects.

---

# Question: What is a common limitation or issue when using the `%` operator for tuples?

**Answer:**
When using `%` with a tuple directly, Python may raise a `TypeError` because it treats the tuple as multiple values. Wrapping the tuple in another tuple (single-item tuple) fixes this but is awkward.

---

# Question: What is an advantage of the `.format()` method over the `%` operator?

**Answer:**
The `.format()` method supports Python’s string formatting mini-language and allows positional and keyword arguments for clearer and more flexible interpolation.

---

# Question: How can you specify the order of arguments in `.format()`?

**Answer:**
You can specify order using zero-based indices inside the curly braces, like `{1}` or `{0}`, to change the interpolation order.

---

# Question: How do you use a dictionary with `.format()` for string interpolation?

**Answer:**
You can pass a dictionary and unpack it with `**` in `.format()`, then reference keys inside curly braces, e.g., `"{name} {age}".format(**person_dict)`.

---

# Question: How do f-strings improve readability compared to `.format()`?

**Answer:**
F-strings allow direct embedding of expressions within the string literal without needing method calls, making the code more concise and readable.

---

# Question: Can you embed complex expressions inside f-strings?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can embed any valid Python expression inside `{}`, including function calls, method calls, and comprehensions.

---

# Question: How do you use format specifiers inside an f-string?

**Answer:**
After the expression inside `{}`, include a colon `:` followed by the format specifier, e.g., `{value:.2f}` formats a number with two decimals.

---

# Question: Give an example of formatting a date with an f-string.

**Answer:**
Using a `datetime` object, you can format it like: `f"Date: {date:%m/%d/%Y}"`, which outputs the date as "MM/DD/YYYY".

---

# Question: What do the `!s` and `!r` flags do in f-strings?

**Answer:**
`!s` calls the object's `__str__()` method to get a user-friendly string, while `!r` calls `__repr__()` to get a developer-friendly representation.

---

# Question: What is a self-documenting expression in f-strings and why is it useful?

**Answer:**
Using `{variable=}` in an f-string outputs both the variable name and its value, which is helpful for quick debugging.

---

# Question: How does the performance of f-strings compare to `%` and `.format()`?

**Answer:**
F-strings are generally faster than both the `%` operator and the `.format()` method, making them both concise and efficient.

---

# Question: Can format specifiers themselves be dynamic in f-strings?

**Answer:**
Yes, you can use variables inside format specifiers like `{value:{sep}}`, where `sep` defines the format dynamically.

---


# Question: Why is it important to use different types of quotation marks in f-strings?

**Answer:**
Using different quotation marks (single, double, triple-single, and triple-double) allows flexibility in nesting and inserting strings within f-strings. This helps when embedding quotes or dictionary keys, and supports nested f-strings.

---

# Question: What was the quotation mark limitation in f-strings before Python 3.12?

**Answer:**
Before Python 3.12, you couldn’t reuse the same type of quotation mark in both the f-string and its embedded expressions, leading to syntax errors due to unmatched brackets.

---

# Question: What limited the nesting depth of f-strings before Python 3.12?

**Answer:**
The number of available string delimiters limited f-string nesting depth. You could only nest f-strings as deep as the number of different quote types you could use to differentiate levels.

---

# Question: How did Python 3.12 improve f-string nesting?

**Answer:**
Python 3.12 removed the limitation on reusing quotes, allowing unlimited nesting of f-strings regardless of the type or number of quote delimiters.

---

# Question: What was the limitation of using backslashes in f-strings before Python 3.12?

**Answer:**
Backslashes weren’t allowed inside f-string expressions before Python 3.12, causing syntax errors when using escape sequences like `\n` in curly braces.

---

# Question: How did Python 3.12 change the use of backslashes in f-strings?

**Answer:**
Python 3.12 allowed backslashes in f-string expressions, enabling the use of escape sequences like newline characters directly within the expressions.

---

# Question: Could you use inline comments in f-string expressions before Python 3.12?

**Answer:**
No, using the `#` symbol inside f-string expressions before Python 3.12 would result in a syntax error. Python 3.12 now allows inline comments within expressions.

---

# Question: How did Python 3.12 improve error messages for f-strings?

**Answer:**
Python 3.12, using the PEG parser, provides clearer and more specific error messages for f-string issues, including exact error location and helpful suggestions.

---

# Question: Why might using `.format()` be preferred over f-strings for dictionary interpolation?

**Answer:**
`.format()` can unpack a dictionary using `**` and reference keys by name, resulting in cleaner and more readable code than using dictionary lookups in f-strings.

---

# Question: Why should you avoid f-strings in logging statements?

**Answer:**
F-strings are eagerly evaluated even if the logging level is too low to show the message. Using `%` with logging enables lazy evaluation, improving performance.

---

# Question: Why should f-strings be avoided in SQL query construction?

**Answer:**
Using f-strings or other interpolation methods to build SQL queries directly invites SQL injection. The recommended approach is to use parameterized queries via `%s` placeholders and pass arguments separately.

---

# Question: What’s the safe way to pass parameters in SQL queries in Python?

**Answer:**
Use `%s` placeholders in the query string and pass the parameters as a separate tuple to the `.execute()` method, allowing the database driver to safely handle them.

---

# Question: Which string interpolation method is recommended for internationalization?

**Answer:**
The `.format()` method is recommended because it works well with string templates and allows dynamic insertion of localized content based on user locale.

---

# Question: What tool can help convert old Python strings to f-strings?

**Answer:**
The `flynt` tool can automatically convert `%` and `.format()`-based strings into f-strings in a Python codebase, aiding modernization.

---

# Question: How does the `flynt` tool help in modernizing code?

**Answer:**
`flynt` scans Python files and rewrites older string formatting styles (`%` and `.format()`) as f-strings, improving readability and performance with minimal effort.

---

# Question: Why is Python considered an awesome programming language?

You use the `print()` function. For example: `print("Hello")` prints text, and `print(f"Age: {age}")` prints a variable using an f-string.

---

# Question: How do you use strings in Python?

**Answer:**
Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single, double, or triple quotes. You can concatenate them with `+`, repeat with `*`, and manipulate them with methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, and `.split()`.

---

# Question: What are indexing and slicing in Python?

**Answer:**
Indexing accesses a specific character in a string using its position (e.g., `s[0]`). Slicing retrieves a substring using a range of positions (e.g., `s[1:4]`).

---
